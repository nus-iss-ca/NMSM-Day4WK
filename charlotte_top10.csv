ch174,1/3/2015,revch1,2,"This place just didn't do it for me. The waitress was too interested in selling us stuff and the food wasn't great. We started off with a sausage tower and that was worth it. Everything after was crap. I asked the waitress for something like a ""brat"" and she brought me more like a petrified hot dog. It looked like breakfast sausage. It also had condiments for a hamburger rather than a hot dog or ""brat"" which made absolutely no sense. Who just wants a toasted bun and extra long breakfast sausage? Not me! I also had their Bavarian potato soup and it looked good but really it lacked flavor and the supposed sliced sausage in it was more like sliced ballpark franks. What's sad is I could have had a better loaded sausage at Wienerschnitzel.",negative
ch174,12/28/2014,revch2,5,"Great place! We started off the vegas trip for a friend that is getting married here. The Liter beers were great but what was better was seeing the bachelor get spanked after taking a shot. priceless.

I highly recommend this place. The food was pretty good too and they had a live band while we were there on a thursday night.",positive
ch174,12/27/2014,revch3,4,"Yes, there are some nods to American tourist expectations here BUT...

I had the pleasure of hosting some folks from Bavaria (Regensburg and down in Austria) for a convention in LV and gave them some choices for Christmas dinner.  They chose this place and I have to say I was worried, knowing Americans' propensity to ""Disney-fy"" everything.

They guys loved it saying it was like being home.  Perhaps the HB in Munich is different (and I suspect more than a little driven at tourists as well) but a group of 10 folks who would know found this place perfectly acceptable.

 
It wasn't very busy being Christmas but we made our own party and the band and staff appreciated our efforts.  

The food was good enough and the flavors were as expected.  The jeagerschnitzel wasn't the best I've had in Germany but it was good compared to the crap I've had in American ""German"" restaurants.  The gerkhin salat was great, pretzels were spot on and everyone cleaned their plate.

Yes, the beer is a little expensive but it's brought in directly from Germany without having a different recipe like most ""German"" beers imported to the US, so there is additional cost involved.  It was great to be able to hold a 1 litre mug, singing with the band and swaying back and forth with everyone else in the bench seating.

I WOULD say that coming just for food is a waste... the whole idea is to get in to the fun of being in a German beer hall.  So, if you're looking for a quiet evening out, please go to Joel Robuchon and leave the rest of us to drink and do the chicken dance :)",positive
ch174,12/27/2014,revch4,2,"Though I've never had German food, this wasn't good. The food was salty and plain. Very over priced and not worth it. I wouldn't recommend to eat here,!stop in and take a look is good enough!!",negative
ch174,12/24/2014,revch5,5,"Tikka Takke Tikka Takke Oi Oi Oi!

It's a Bavarian German mess hall with bench seating and bosomed bar maids and boots of booze!

My favorite imported brews are served in giant glass steins with strong heft to them.  Dunkel brau ist mein favorite.  Strangely enough I find a connection with my 3rd generation removed Germanic bloodline to be very intoxicating at Hofbrau.  Decorated in faux old fatherland fixings.  The atmosphere is most inviting and exiting as you are transported to the old castle days reminiscent of lederhosen and clogs.  Think St. Pauli girl in practice.  Various Germanic accents abound they really have a knack for the ""Vegas recreation"" feel here.

The traditional brats wieners and Vienna sausages on order are accompanied quite stoutly with the beers on tap and the pretzels and bitter sides with sauerkraut are an attestment to the dedication to the stout beer this culture has dedicated itself to throughout history.  In other words everything on the menu tastes much better with a glug of beer.  Seriously not knocking the taste of the food in general, but much like most European countries the cuisine is somewhat mated to the alcoholic beverage of favor.  You seriously can't fully appreciate the food with out the drink.  Sour goes great with stout. 

The entertainment is live and seemingly imported as well.  Lively stereotypical lederhosen wearing front man singing and commanding communal cheers throughout the meal.  It is a good idea to keep the large steins filled.  Raise a glass.  Shout an old world cheer.  Take a big drink and slam the glass on the table.  What medieval fun.  Sure to find yourself tipsy you may be ordered a Jeager paddle with assorted shots from which you will be challenged to gullet down in concession and afterwards the bar maids will give you one Hell of a brutal paddling for being a bad boy!  Old drinking game contests may be held from the band and you can possibly get a glass stein for winning.

Major fun can be had at the Hofbruahaus!  Make sure to stagger into the gift shop afterwards and check out the great trinkets mugs and grab a six pack of the great beer for your hangover in the morning.

Prost!",positive
ch174,12/23/2014,revch6,5,"Love this pace! Fun, authentic, great atmosphere! I've been to Hofbrauhaus in Munich, Germany and it was such a great experience, I was pleasantly surprised to find the Hofbrauhaus in Las Vegas managed to capture the same fun atmosphere and great tasting beer and food. Would definitely recommend.",positive
ch174,12/23/2014,revch7,5,"This is our second time in, each time with friends who came into town. Ask for Amanda!!! Tip her well. The service is great, the food is better. You, your family and friends will have a great time here. Ask for Amanda and you will have an especially good time. Drink beer, eat food and laugh!",positive
ch174,12/11/2014,revch8,5,"Have never experienced German food.. the pork sausage.. was amazing.  The beer ""Dunkel"" was smooth... no bitterness.  Great experience",positive
ch174,12/8/2014,revch9,2,"We've been to Hofbrauhaus on previous visits to Vegas and always had a good experience.  After this trip, I have no desire to go back.  We were there for an early dinner, so the service was bit rushed since they weren't busy yet.  We ordered a pretzel for an appetizer.  I recall them being served warm.  This one was cold, so it was just OK.  After being asked several times, we ordered the Veal brats for dinner - it arrived within minutes, so it was all pre-cooked apparently.  This made me very glad we hadn't placed the order earlier.  The meal actually was delicious.  That was the best part of the evening.  What really put a damper on the evening, though, was ordering a shot at the end.  Don't order a shot unless you want a big welt on your butt!  We didn't realize this was the consequence.  On previous trips, members of our party had ordered a shot and did not get whacked.  This time, the staff was very eager and insistent about it.  I was very uncomfortable and was going to leave it (my boyfriend ordered the shot for me), but he finally drank it.  A server other than ours was instantly over and eager to deliver the punishment.  She was actually kind of mean about it and my boyfriend still has a welt on his behind 5 days later.  I guess they get a twisted satisfaction out of being mean to the people to leave them tips for slightly overpriced beer and food.  I was mad because he was really looking forward to going and ended up being in pain for the rest of the evening and the next day.  Hofbrauhaus definitely won't be on my list of places to go on my next trip to Vegas!",negative
ch174,11/30/2014,revch10,2,"Eh.

The beer is tasty when you're on an empty stomach.

we arrived 2 hours before they closed and our waitress wasn't really helpful and seemed urged to close our tab.

the food was Ok, I had the curry dish. the prices are above average, especially for the pint of beer I had. 

would recommend it if it's your first time or if you're a tourist (which i'm not)

Oh, and they sat us aaaall way in the back where nobody was at while they had a live band playing up front, I guess the host's really look out for certain waitresses/servers. 

you won't see me coming here again...",negative
ch174,11/26/2014,revch11,4,"Stopped in for lunch on our 1st day in Vegas-my husband had a burger, the patty was big n juicy, the rest of us had some kinda schnitzel - that was the reason for coming, we wanted to try German food 
Live music, the DJ has a strong German accent that was hard to understand, either that or due to the amount of beer he's drinking, not sure which.
Regardless , he was very entertaining - service was good-glad we came.",positive
ch174,11/26/2014,revch12,3,"I never had real German food until I tried this place. I ordered a white asparagus soup which was oh so tasty. It was creamy and flavorful.

I ordered the chicken sausage which was okay. Ever since I tried the sauerkraut, I've been craving it.

The atmosphere is fun and people here have a good time. There's live music and people are just happy and friendly.",negative
ch174,11/25/2014,revch13,3,I'm not a fan of the German beer or festival but the ambiance and the music was pretty cool.  I could not remember the name let alone say what I ordered but it was basically a thin piece of pork lightly battered with a side of cranberry sauce.  It was pretty damn good and the portion size was huge. I didn't order a beer and was called a girly man by the pretty german waitress. HAHAHA funnay.   This place looks fun once your drunk and in the moment.  the ziggy ziggy oi oi oi was fun.,negative
ch174,11/23/2014,revch14,4,"First time there,I was  in serious bratwurst withdrawals.  Ordered the combo plate of chicken, pork, and something else, with mashed potatoes and sauerkraut.  Wasn't do thrilled with the sauerkraut, the rest was awesome.wife had pork rotary and gravy I helped her to finish. Also really good. Place is rather loud, but the food was great. Will rotten again",positive
ch174,11/20/2014,revch15,3,"Pretty cool I guess I mean not bad for a slow Thursday night. Well me and a friend were in Vegas for short weekend getaway from LA and on our first night we decided to go across the street from our hotel (HardRock) and check this place out. Mainly because he is more of a beer guy and big German culture fan. Anyways we got here around 7:15 or so on a Thursday night and it was somewhat busy but at the same time kinda low energyish and meh. Again your in Vegas so don't expect to find a super big German area like Alpine village so go figure lol. We had a sausage platter sampler thing and it was pretty good as well as a few beers and just enjoyed and kinda relaxed while listening to live music and enjoying some people watching. All in all it was ok not the best but cant complain too much either. The sound system ,I will say, is not the best kinda off balanced and somewhat all over the place half of the time you don't know if they are speaking or singing in English, German or just hard to understand muffled something because yea the sound system is not the best. If I was in the area and just wanted sit around drink beers and enjoy somewhat of a German American ambiance I would defiantly think about coming here again. But if your not particularly a beer person or a fan of uncomfortable seating then maybe pass on this place blah.",negative
ch174,11/19/2014,revch16,5,"Food was absolutely amazing. First time here, I ordered the snitzel combo which was one of the specials for today and got a liter mug of beer. I'm not usually a beer drinking but I loved the beer! The live band was pretty amazing as well. Overall the atmosphere, the band, the service was great! I will definitely be coming back again!",positive
ch174,11/13/2014,revch17,3,"Very good schnitzel and good service, but the apple strudel was not very sweet and the place is super duper loud.  Its a big German beer hall with lots of people laughing and shouting.  All of the noise bounces of the walls and you cannot hear any conversation.  Good beer too.",negative
ch174,11/11/2014,revch18,2,"Hadn't been here for a few years and stopped in last night with a few friends. Beers are way too frickin' expensive at $9 for a pint. The bratwurst deal my buddy bought had the skinniest sausage on the planet and way too much bread, see picture.

Really dead with hardly anyone there and the hostess lied on the phone saying Monday was a great night with a good crowd. Our waitress was mediocre and the band was pretty boring to be honest.

We won't be going back.",negative
ch174,11/6/2014,revch19,4,"Fun German Octoberfest.  Be sure and order a shot, you'll be glad you did! ;-)

I think if you're in Las Vegas, and want to break away for some fun drinking and eating, this is a great alternative.  You won't feel like you're in Vegas, you'll be transported to Bavaria for a bit.",positive
ch174,11/4/2014,revch20,4,"To celebrate Oktoberfest we went to Hofbrauhaus. I forgot that a friend told me that you get seated with strangers on the big long table. I asked the waitress if we can sit somewhere but she kindly rejected. The strangers were guys from Toronto and they were pretty funny and photo bombed us. The food was good, I remember having the famous Bavarian sausage. The price was high though. My friend ordered chicken salad and it was something like $16 she read the menu wrong. There is a section below the entree where it says chicken add this price shrimp add this price . Anyways she thought she could have a better dinner elsewhere. The place is huge with high ceiling. It was very entertaining and loud. A man comes around with big horn and put it on each table and people put money inside and ladies walk around selling shot and the men get paddled. There is German music and every now and then they would cheer and everyone on the table cheered ""Ein Prosit! Zicke, zacke, zicke, zacke, hoi, hoi, hoi, Zicke, zacke, zicke, zacke, hoi, hoi, hoi. Prosit.""
LOL! Good times!!",positive
ch174,11/1/2014,revch21,5,"You want some good German beer and food with great atmosphere? Then this is the spot in Vegas. Awesome staff. Great food. Delicious beer. Came here during their Oktoberfest, awesome! They celebrate it Oct 1st-31st. Take a shot and get paddled!!",positive
ch174,10/26/2014,revch22,4,"I'm not a huge fan of the food at the Hofbräuhaus, but it has the best beer in town and an atmosphere that can't be duplicated. (Unless, perhaps, you're in Bavaria. And even there, I doubt you'll hear a guy mixing traditional German songs with reggae and the ""Hogan's Heroes"" theme song.)

My husband and I met some friends for lunch on a Saturday. We arrived at noon, and the place was nearly empty. By the time we left at 1:30, however, the place was rocking, no doubt due to the entertainment (a one-man band) that began at 1. It was also extremely loud, so if you're looking to have an intimate meal, this is NOT your place! If you're looking for a good, raucous time, give the Haus a whirl.

As I said, the food is not the draw here; it's the beer. We each had a liter of the Oktoberfest, which is a nice, smooth lager. As much a I enjoyed this seasonal offering (and it was the main reason we all decided to meet here for lunch), I was craving the Hofbräu Original, so I got myself a 0.5-liter mug as well. So tasty! And so pricey -- $17 for the Oktoberfest, and $8 for the Original. (Hey, I said it was tasty. I didn't say it was cheap!)

My friends split a jumbo pretzel, complete with sides of mustard, cheese spread, and liver pate. At around $17.50, this was one expensive appetizer. Although they enjoyed their app, my husband and I skipped straight to the entrees. I had the beer sausage (a bratwurst), which was on ""special"" for $16, and he had his old standby, the leberkäse, which is like an upscale grilled Spam loaf. (Sounds bad, but it's oh so good.) My friends had the beer sausage and the giant bratwurst sandwich, and they split of piece of Black Forest cake for dessert. Total damage for lunch (pre-tip): $190. Eek!

There are two dining rooms in the building, and we've sat in both of them. On this occasion, the smaller, indoor beer garden was closed, so we sat in the large beer hall up front. There's usually some sort of entertainment going on, and at night this place can get REALLY loud -- especially during the popular keg-tapping events. So be forewarned. And you'll probably drop a lot of money, if our lunch bill is any indication. But if you're in the mood for a semi-authentic German experience (albeit by Vegas standards), the Hofbräuhaus is the place to go.",positive
ch174,10/24/2014,revch23,2,"HATED IT!  We were invited to a ""family dinner"" with my daughter's new inlaws who were visiting from out-of-town.   We normally try to avoid anything near the strip, but we accepted the invitation.
  The place was a freakin' zoo!   Jam packed and extremely loud!   We couldn't even hear the people sitting next to us, so having a conversation was impossible.
  The food wasn't that great, and overpriced.  Small portions.
  Service was horrible.  There were about 25 of us and we had 2 waitresses.   Our food arrived..... however several of our guests did not receive their food until about 15 minutes later!    
  The best part of the night was watching my new son-in-law get ""spanked"" by the German dominatrix.   Yes... that was fun!
  I guess we're just old fuddy-duddies because we did not enjoy the LOUD atmosphere at all.   We will never go back.",negative

ch174,10/21/2014,revch25,5,"We had our wedding reception here. We had about 30 people and it ended up being buffet. The food was wonderful and the staff were prompt and nice! The pork roast was amazing and so tender!!!!

Originally we requested the beer hall, but it was insane being Oktoberfest, so they moved us to the gardens. I actually think this was a better idea and they gave us a big screen tv to watch the festivities in the beer hall. 

Due to a family issue, we initially had 58 people we contracted for, but it ended up being 31 people instead. Although the contract was written that we would lose money on guests 31-48, they offered us some options that made us feel a lot better about our experience. 

I would definitely suggest this restaurant for large groups and wedding receptions. It was so much fun!!

Big thanks to Karen K who helped us arrange everything!",positive

ch174,10/14/2014,revch30,1,"Be warned they are ""open""  until 11 but won't serve past 10:15. Took a cab all the way there knowing they closed at 11 just to be turned away at 10:15. Very disappointing! I thought this was Vegas?  If you don't allow anyone in past 10:15 list that as closing time! Who turns away thirsty people?  Update your information. Waste of time and cab ride.",negative

ch174,10/11/2014,revch32,2,"I really wanted to love the Hofbrauhaus as we just moved from Germany to Vegas and was craving a German experience.  We won't be back.   It was not authentic at all and nothing like the place in Munich.

I called first to be sure they had their great alcoholfrei biers as they do Munich since I'm pregnant. They said yes.  When I got there they acted confused and had one option in a bottle, not the usual hefeweizen, etc.  The waitress apologized for the not-so-smart hostesses that answered the phone.  That was super aggravating!  We ordered the jäger schnitzel and it wasn't schnitzel at all but a dried out pork chop that I been Americanized.  German food doesn't come with so many toppings or garnishes and the pork is pounded thin.  It was also cold...and pricey!  We had a reservation for 4, but two were running late.  They only gave us space at a table for two.

The keg tapping for Oktoberfest was also lackluster.  Maybe if you haven't been to Munich you'd find it mildly entertaining. If you have, keep those memories and skip the vegas location.",negative
ch174,10/7/2014,revch33,5,"We were here Friday for part of the Frozen Fury weekend. Our reservations were ready and on time. The server was very polite and got all of our order right. The atmosphere is awesome, especially since it was filled with other Kings fans. Got the Das Boot (2 liter) and filled it with the Oktoberfest, which was delicious. I ordered the chicken sausage to eat, but after a total of 3 liters of beer I can't give an honest, sober review of the food, but I loved it. There were ladies walking around with $5 shots and you get spanked with a paddle. She hits hard! Definitely looking forward to next year!",positive
ch174,10/6/2014,revch34,1,"I've been to Germany, and I've been to the original Haufbräuhaus.  The atmosphere at this location is great but the food is horrible. The first time I was there for lunch - this was at least 7 years ago, their mashed potatoes tasted like they were from a box and their saurcraut was fresh out of a can and not properly rinsed.  Just went for their Oktoberfest  celebration. I was excited and hopeful that their food had changed.  Nope. Ordered a large pretzel  to share.  Pretzel came out cold and a bit hard. I was excited tho for their currywurst  since I have been craving it since I left Germany. I've had about 8 currywursts in my life and this was the most disgusting currywurst ever. How can you mess up a street cart food like currywurst?! Also they cut up an American hotdog and placed it on top of my fries  for some unknown reason. I'm not ever going back.  I can get my fix of good German beer from the local liquor stores and if I am craving German food I'll go to the Berlin Cafe.",negative

ch174,9/30/2014,revch36,5,"Jaegermeister, tonight was flavorful!thankfully the mushroom gravy not overly salty perfect with mushrooms abundant enough to not have to hunt for! 
The Oktoberfest beer was yummy enough for a second!  

The band was different on this visit. Change is good! It's reasonable that locals might tire of the same ol same ol or maybe all of my visits happened to have been on nights the old band was booked. 

Blood sausage caught my dining partners attention. By the time I glanced at his plate to ask for a bite.... It was gone!  As it was a first for him I asked before it was served what his plan was if he didn't find it to his liking!  His response ... ""Eat it !""  His take on it? It's ""ok"". I don't think he's a fan! 

Fun way to spend a late afternoon! I've felt for a very long time that Hofbrau Haus is a gem among many in Vegas. For us tho it's a taste of one of our homes... It's sister location in Newport KY was home to many of our family celebrations.",positive

We went on a Saturday night and reaped all this place had to offer. Fun fun fun!

ch174,9/27/2014,revch39,3,"Atmosphere- We were here on a Monday evening and it was pretty quiet.  I would like to try on a weekend to get the full effect.  Only one other couple was seated at our table, so we had plenty of room to set our large beers and plates of food.  The band was playing, however they only played two German songs- I was kind of disappointed.  Still, there were larger groups there and they were getting pretty rowdy, it was fun interacting with them! 

Service- Our server was fine, certainly not extraordinary.  I was expecting a little more enthusiasm, this is a beer hall after all!  We did have a coupon for a small free beer with purchase of an entree and we were able to redeem without any issues.  

Food-  The food was average.  Large portions, so expect leftovers or share plates.  They definitely missed the mark on the pretzel, did not taste fresh and it wasn't served warm.  The beer was excellent.

The food is definitely mediocre, but nothing the singalongs and the drunken chants would not make up for (if that's your thing).

Their Jaggersnitzel is to die for!  I also tried sides of their spatzle and potato salad.  Spatzle is always never as good as I hope it sounds it will be but, it was ok and their potato salad was really good.  I love a good potato salad and those Germans know how to make it!  My boyfriend got a sausage plate and he did enjoy it although he's not a fatty food fan!  I also got a small Das Boot!!  It was small and plastic and I really wanted the larger glass one but, those were over 70$ and too much beer for me!  But, my small Das Boot was all I needed and it was filled with the most delicious Hefeweizen I have ever put my lips on!! Holy Cow I dream about that beer to this day!!

ch174,9/3/2014,revch48,2,"I'd first heard of the Hofbräuhaus on the Food Network a few years ago. It was highly recommended for it's authentic food and dining atmosphere from what I remember.

I love, love, love German food, and hadn't had any in several months, plus after skipping lunch in favor of a few pitchers of poolside drinks, my husband and I were really in the mood for some salty, carb-y food...and what could be better than spaetzle!

I was aware of the live entertainment and therefore brought earplugs. I'm glad I did! As we walked in the dining room, there was a lady standing on the bench of her community table, clapping to the Dire Straights cover band. Also, if spankings by dirndl-wearing waitresses is on your bucket list (for some reason) you can get, or watch that done here.

Overall, the food was decent, definitely got the carbs we came for but I've been spoiled by Uwe's in Colorado Springs. Hofbräuhaus doesn't live up, but in all fairness that's a very high bar!

If you're not into the kinda touristy place that has an attached gift shop, I'd skip it.",negative
ch174,9/3/2014,revch49,3,"Meh.  It's decent food, but nothing to write home about.  

I had a plate of sausages with mashed potatoes and sauerkraut, my wife had jagetschnitzle, and she definitely chose better than I did, but neither of us were all that impressed.  The servers were nice, but not all that quick to refill water (I realize this is not the sort of place one normally orders water, but I was already all liquored up and looking for something hearty to help soak up my liquid lunch). 

If I were, for some reason, to go back here I'd probably order my food from the bar next to the gift shop.  That way I could avoid the obnoxiously loud cafeteria-esque dining room and the utterly terrible live music.  And even if the food wasn't extraordinary it was at least decent and decently priced.  This might be a fun place to go with a big group, but not really what I was looking for.",negative

ch174,8/21/2014,revch52,4,"This wasn't my first time to Hofbrauhaus, but it was my first time to this location.  Just a short taxi trip off the strip, Hofbrau is a beer drinkers delight.  German beerhall fashion tables, live music a liter beers.  What more could you possibly want?  There's more. 

During our hour or so long visit, (plus a short wait), many, many people were spanked, yes spanked, by the more than willing females servers.  We did not partake, but it was fun to watch. 

In addition, the cheerful dancing on benches, live music, and stein holding contests were all exciting, fun happenings to keep us entertained.  We went for the pretzels and sausages and the food was quite good as well. 

Prost!",positive
ch174,8/19/2014,revch53,3,"Decent-enough German food, gigantic beer steins, live traditional music, and public humiliation. They seem to pride themselves on not being a tourist destination, but let's get real: very few people come here more than once for anything but the novelty.

Considering half of Texas, where I'm from, was settled by Germans, the food here did not live up to my expectations given the price point- but we have few restaurants turning out this cuisine here, so some inflation is to be expected.
$60 dinner for two, splitting a plate, an app, and a beer? Not really worth it, IMO. Quality was just not there for the majority of the items.

Kartoffelpuffer - Two crisp and golden brown Potato Pancakes served with smoked Salmon and traditional garnish; it's like going to a Jewish deli for breakfast and being torn between the pancakes and the lox, and deciding to combine them. Not bad, but pancakes aren't seasoned at all.  $15

Special Plate of the Day- pork loin served with two kinds of sausage, sauerkraut and mashed potatoes, sided with gravy and mustard. Sausages weren't bad, one was considerably better than the other. Pork was unremarkable, as were the 'kraut and 'taters. $20

The beer. Good lord, I have no idea which beer my guy opted for, but we got the 36oz stein and it was huge but we drank it all without problem because it was light, smooth, and delicious. Complemented the sausages, as it's supposed to. HB prides itself on only importing beers that meet the traditional purity law, with simple, classic ingredients only. Mad hops, I mean props, to their beer! $16

The reason I can't tell you which sausage was the best is because service is mostly nonexistent. I guess if your basic couple is likely to spend $100, and most people tip 20%, you don't have to do much to get halfway decent pay by default.
Our waitress took our order, kitchen staff brought it out and took it away, waitress brought our bill. The end. Gave us a vague and rushed ""you good?"" as she walked by once, but otherwise did the bare minimum.
There was a featured dessert trio, but only one sounded appealing. Disappointed that they are unable to accommodate an order for a single dessert without spending $15 on the bunch of them.",negative
ch174,8/17/2014,revch54,4,"The schnitzel was a good average schnitzel. Probably some of the better schnitzel you will find in the US. The potato salad was different than the potato salad from Germany, but still good. The burger was a very good quality, tasty and moist. I would highly recommend the burger. It is not what you would normally expect. The Black Forest cake is very good and moist. The sauce is to die for. The Hofbräu beer is a true German beer that is not common to most restaurants. I would recommend this restaurant for anyone to visit. It is a good, close to authentic German meal.",positive
ch174,8/14/2014,revch55,4,"Wow, tough to give it four stars, but I am going to do that. I will explain why. Beer should never be $16 for a draught beer. Sure it is one liter in size, but really who came up with that price? You almost feel obligated to spend it because the smaller beers are $9 so you might as well splurge and get the full Bavarian experience.

So why 4 stars? The food. Let me tell you after spending five years in Germany and knowing what Bavarian food should taste like, it is spot on. Really rich and authentic. I had the Cheese Plate appetizer which had American cheese on it, but don't let that bother you, it was done well and you get the same plate in Bavaria anyway. 

The Bratenteller is a mixture of Pork and beef with red cabbage and Spatzle. Authentic in every way and so good every bite was made with some sort of noise like umm, yumm, mmm, etc. 

Entertainment is good but in my opinion it should be louder. 

You will be seated with total strangers unless you indicate your comfort is not there, but sitting with strangers is the Bavarian way and I met some of the most fantastic people including a family from Ireland. 

So money aside, bring a hundred so you can get just a little of everything and at least 2 beers to get the full effect. This is a great place to celebrate someone's birthday or anniversary or whatever. Just make sure you tell your waiter and they may do something special for you.",positive

We were seated shortly before we were expected (we had a reservation for 8 PM) and were seated in the dining hall. It was incredibly loud! At the end you fill out a survey and it asked if the music was too loud and I had to say that the crowd was too loud. Maybe it was just the time of night. The music that I did hear was not German (lots of recognizable party songs) and the entertainment was amusing.

My food was delicious! We split potato pancakes (Kartoffelpuffer) with salmon. I got the pork schnitzel and a side of spaetzle (my favorite holiday meal!). I wish that there had been a selecion of German wine but I did not see any on the menu. I spent more than I was expecting but it did taste good.

ch174,7/30/2014,revch63,2,"I took my German family here while they were in town visiting my girlfriend and I (she's German). Wow, what a disappointment. 

First of all, this place is priced like this is universal studios... Inside disneyland... Inside Disney world. Seriously. 16-18 dollars for 1 liter beer?! Ja, OK! That's a bit of exaggeration ( though the price is accurate), but the whole place felt like you were being hard sold to spend more money. I mean the desserts are TEN dollars! Items like that make this place outrageously priced, and not affordable for a regular visit. 

The second part that was a disappointment was our waitress. She obviously didn't know much if anything about Germany or the menu, seriously mispronouncing a few items over and over even after my German family repeated it back the right way. Now, I'm not a stickler for doing some sort of accent or anything, but it showed a lack of authenticity there, and I appreciate a place that tries to give you the real feel (especially in Las Vegas!)

What's more, we felt like she was trying to push things on us, and the second we said hey... We had some coupons for 2 free beers with dinner... She became quite unfriendly and unhelpful. We got the impression we weren't spending enough money for her. I get being a server is difficult, been there... But we were a very easy table and the place wasn't nearly full. No need to flip the switch just because we aren't going nuts on ordering stuff.

I almost laughed out loud when she came by with a ""retail menu"" and told us to order our gift shop items through her so that she gets the credit...really? I can't remember the last place a shopping menu was pushed on you. 

We also didn't particularly enjoy the music, it's very cheesy, and since my family isn't from Bavaria, they could not stand that kind of music haha we were excited to leave. 

To be fair, the bratwurst sampler dinner and the schnitzel were decent quality, which is what earned this 2 stars instead of one. However we saw a really strange pattern at our table and the tables around us... Orders came out no more than 5-10 minutes after being placed. Like our full entrees! I've worked at enough restaurants to know there is some serious pre-cooking going on back there, as nothing can be cooked to order so fast. At this price, that's just another reason to not go back.",negative

I also screamed lyrics in a foreign language that I didn't understand nor had any clue what I was saying, and also sang Garth Brooks to my friends.

Besides the drinking, the food is nothing to get excited about. I'm personally not a big German food fan, so paying a high price for food I don't like isn't so appealing. I'm still shocked that a pretzel was $14. How much does it really cost to make a pretzel?! Yes it's large, but not big enough to justify the cost. And it tasted like every other pretzel. I tried one of the sausage dishes, and well, it tasted like sausage. Nothing special.

They have all your wursts and schnitzels here; I got the schnitzel that wasn't all breaded and fried, and I thought it was pretty good, but like most other items on the menu a bit overpriced. I'd been here once before just to grab a cold brew and it's surprising that they don't have a lot of different beers here; there's only a few varieties, if memory serves. I just went with a lager, which was a refreshing accompaniment to my hearty meal. We were kept entertained during the meal by the one-man band playing his heart out on the stage.

Ambiance and Location: 5
I've bumped this section to the top because your primary reason for your visit to this place should be to get smashed and have a good time (not fine dining). We went on the weekend, and it seems like they have a band here on the weekends that really adds to the experience. This, plus a paddle/jagermeister lady. The band kept coming around playing a large alphorn. They had a drinking contest and my girlfriend participated (free beer!). She lost but overall we had a pretty good time. I'm local-ish and I would still call this strip-ish. Close enough for a tourist, but far away enough from the strip to not be considered the strip.
+2 drinking contests, getting the crowd involved.
It would be a good idea to take a _____ here: group of guys to get smashed

Service Quality: 6
My visit seems to be unlike other reviews. Our service was prompt, friendly, quick and accurate. We did notice some people who appeared like they needed better wait service, but this did not impact us (no negative score). Perhaps if you order the large 1L beers you don't need the waiter to tend to you so much and by ordering the large beers you can be proactive at preventing a bad service experience.

Related but no impact on score: the gift store is friendly. Though it says they close at midnight parts of the restaurant close earlier so do not come here right at midnight expecting service. I would recommend 9-10 if you're doing it late.
+1 friendly. +1 fast. +1 accurate. 
Time it took from ordering to get the food to the table: suspiciously fast (5 minutes, see food section).
_____________________
Food Quality: 1
A big let down. Most likely I will eat before coming here again. Only a few of the items we ordered appeared to be scratch made. I ordered the sausage platter, and I wondered if some of the sausages I got were the same ones I could get canned from World Market. They looked, felt (mouthfeel for consistency of sausage feeling) and tasted processed, not like scratch-made sausages. My first thought, even drinking: ""I paid $20 for hot dogs ...?"" Even the mashed potatoes were instant, or they were so poorly prepared as to seem like instant mashed potatoes. To cement this idea that it was instant: the food came out in 5 minutes. They offer a 'traditional poached style' where your sausages will be delivered in the water they were poached in. I was open to this, but I bet people will be put off by it; maybe upset if they pay $20 for a single entree. Overall the food quality was below average, with extravagant prices. An entree of 4 sausages, instant mashed potatoes and a side of sauerkraut came to $20. The one good item was the pretzel, which you could--and we did--order with some liver mousse came out to be $16. 

So you should probably not come here to eat. You should come here to get the big 1L beers. They come in big authentic 1L mugs and are pretty awesome. This is probably why you came here. Inevitably you will get drunk and probably order food, which is the only circumstance I would recommend buying the food, so you don't have the weight of paying $20 for instant mashed potatoes on your conscience. 
-1 extravagant prices. -2 deeply disappointed with the food. +1 great beer. 
What I'd get here: just beer.

We ordered the appetizer mini pretzel and the breaded pork with a side of potato salad and cranberry sauce. The pretzel was really good as well as the meal we were able to share.

I found the place strange, not somewhere Id hangout plus German style food is not usually on my menu so I was clueless..tall lady with bigunz walkin around with a paddle and grown men willing to get smacked in the backside by her.. Ok the food was good, real good.. The beer was great.. I had another..and by my second one I realized this is the most fun I've had in a while..it was crazy in there, they were nuts! It was loud and so much stuff goin on.. Singing and dancing most I didn't understand yet I was having a great time.. Just wished I had the pretzels before the beers..it was one hell of a time.. Can't wait to do it again.. Next week...",positive
ch174,6/24/2014,revch85,5,"Love their beer!!   I was over the moon when I discovered they had a beer hall in Vegas, so this place was a definite must on places to visit while there.

We had perfect timing as Germany was playing in the World Cup when we happened to swing by.  What an amazingly fun atmosphere.  My husband got the sauerbraten (very tender and not uber sour) and loved it.  I had a bite and definitely wanted more.  I don't tend to like a lot of German food (sorry), just not my flavor palette, but I definitely enjoyed theirs.  I even liked the side of cabbage (my husband didn't as much as another local to us German restaurant).  I had to get the Bavarian Cheese appetizer with pretzel and a caesar salad, both were mouth watering.  But the true highlight for me was their beer.  I was in 7th heaven!!  The downside, they were charging for water - when the bill came they charged us $4 for a bottle of water that normally costs around $1 at a gas station.  This was the most expensive lunch I think I have ever had, but it was worth it for us.  Their hefe weizen is phenomenal!  In case I forgot to mention that before ;P",positive
ch174,6/17/2014,revch86,5,"This is one of my favorite restaurants to visit in Vegas! 

The large bier garden setting makes for a fun locale to enjoy authentic German cuisine and some delicious brews as well. There is always live music to add to the atmosphere. Waitresses walk around offering shots of jaeger, but they come with a spanking. This is a fun and entertaining tradition, especially when you buy spankings, er I mean shots, for your friends. 

The food is delicious and so is the bier, but the prices are little more than what I pay normally. BUT I do try to temper that knowing that we are in Vegas and everything costs more (even though it did not used to be like that). 

If you like German food, bier, music, and atmosphere this is a GREAT night out in Vegas before heading out to party more. I highly recommend.",positive
ch174,6/17/2014,revch87,3,"So I think this place is completely different at night. And to be fair, I was here in the middle of the afternoon.

The ambiance is cool. I liked the big giant hall and getting seated at a table with other people. And the live music was awesome and fun. 4 stars.

We were seated promptly. But then waited over 20 minutes and still not a single server had even glanced at us. Finally, one of the people sitting at the same table as us went to find the server they had (who had just closed them out because her shift was over) and she then came and took our order. She then even delivered our beers. No clue what had happened to the assigned server. When the assigned server did show, there was no apology, no ""I'll cover this round of drinks"", no nothing. Not the type of service one is accustomed to in Vegas. 1 star.

When weren't super hungry, so we just ordered the pretzel. It was a giant pretzel and came with two mustards and the special cheese dip. It was way over-cooked and not tasty. 2 stars.

The beers were decent. There were 3 options, plus the seasonal. They don't offer samples. 3.5 stars.

Meh. It's basically a tourist trap. I hope the actual food is good. Everything seems overpriced. They're big on pushing the gift shop items. Not sure if I'll return.",negative
ch174,6/16/2014,revch88,3,"As a vegan, I was really excited about their vegan option. The place is very unique, because you sit on wooden benches with strangers, people dance on the tables, there's a live ethnic band playing, and waitresses brutally spank people with a paddle when they take a shot.

The food was just all right and overpriced, along with the alcohol (what you'd expect), but it was interesting.",negative
ch174,6/15/2014,revch89,5,I love this place when I want German food. We go there for Breakfast and Dinner.,positive
ch174,6/14/2014,revch90,3,"I had my hopes up for this place. Walking in it seemed like a fun atmosphere, but quickly it felt like more of a tourist attraction. From the start our server was trying to get us to buy raffle tickets. It didn't stop there. When she would check on us, she was saying things like ""if you like the taste of that, we sell it in our gift shop"" and at the end of the meal even asked if she could walk with us to the gift shop (we told her that we didn't want to go earlier and thanked her for the info) to pick somethings out so she could meet her goal since she was in the lead for some sort of competition with the other employees for work. To put people on the spot so many times is rude. Ask once and if the customer is interested they will tell you! 

What encouraged us to come here was because I have family here in town that is hosting an exchange student from Germany and I thought she would not only like this place, but maybe feel a bit of home. We sat at nice long table that is shared with the other customers. I don't personally like that, but that's the theme here so it was fine. There was live music being played which was cool. 

Priced at $19.99 we started out with the ""Sausage Tower"" at the suggestion of our server. She said it was a ""hidden"" menu item since it isn't on the menu and it would give us a good taste of the different sausages they have. Sounded good to me! When it arrived, it looked like a tower of heaven. There were 3 dishes. 1 dish had chicken bratwurst, pork sausage and veal bratwurst on a bed of sauerkraut. The 2nd dish had krainer, grilled weisswurst and a frankfurter with potato salad. The 3rd dish had 2 fresh baked pretzels with 2 types of dipping sauces. Of all the sausages I only really liked the taste of a couple of them, so it was nice to be able to sample it all instead of just ordering a certain sausage dish that I might have had a type of sausage in it that I wasn't to find of. The pretzels were pretty good and the mustard sauces had good flavor. For my meal I had priced at $4.95 a ""House Salad"" and priced at $14.95 the ""Grillhendl"" which is a chicken dish. The salad was average, but the chicken dish was above average. The chicken was roasted and stuffed with parsley, beer butter and onions. The chicken was crispy and had a good flavor. It also came with a side of potato salad that was decent. 

I certainly didn't leave hungry! I didn't leave feeling like I would come back though either. The vibe inside just screamed ""gimmick"" and ""tourist attraction here"" which our guest from Germany agreed. The server was just too pushy about trying to get us to buy different things. My husbands meal was a joke especially for the price, so I lucked out with the chicken dish I ordered. I'm glad I experienced Hofbräuhaus at least once.",negative

ch174,6/6/2014,revch95,4,"It's been a while since I've been to a Hofbrauhaus. The last time I went was in Miami, which I fell in love with. The Las Vegas location is a lot bigger and not as quaint as Miami, I like the more nostalgic era. 

Our visit to the Las Vegas was nice, we came in as Walk In and was seated right away. I really wanted to have the Pork Knuckles, but it was a specialty item that they only serve when it was ordered. I was devastated! But I quickly recovered trying to pick the very next best thing.... 

The Bavarian Potato Soup- Like a loaded baked potato soup minus bacon, but adding their smoked sausage. It was topped off with croutons and chives. 

Sauerbraten- Bavarian style potroast w/red wine. It was good, not as tender as I thought it would be, sauce was dark a bit on salty side which went well with the roast and spatzle. Yes spatzle! They look like gnocci pieces, but its noodles! Love them. 

Red Cabbage- Wasnt a fan, I tried it, tasted like caramelized overly sweet and vinegar red cabbage. I guess this is the Bavarian version of our American cranberry to Turkey dinner. 

Through our meal, there was a band playing and shouting out and drinking! It was Classic! Love it!  

Yes and the dessert! I had to get Apfelstrudel! Apple strudel! It was great! Had to wait for my chantilly cream which made me think about the movie Inglorious Bastard with Hans Landa and the cream for apple strudel.... Reminiscing... It was great, wished the Pork Knuckle was available for us, that was the only reason I would go back for..

So, I'm realistic and I know this is Vegas..........granted, the food at Hofbrauhaus has never been German.  The music....not German.  The atmosphere....not even remotely close to a German Festhaus.  What was originally a pretty fun and laid-back beer spot has become another avenue for ridiculous frat parties and bachelorette night-outs.  Besides the fact the music is turned up to 11, for the price of a shot you can get your ass paddled by a ""woman"" who probably has a Y chromosome in addition to being 7 feet tall.  

If you want a more authentically German experience, it would be more fun to drive 1200 miles to San Antonio.....yes, San Antonio.........and sample real German fare in Gruene, Pflugerville, Boerne, or Fredricksburg, TX.  That's right....you read that correctly.

The restaurant offers lively music and entertainment for patrons to order large pints of Hofbräu München hefewiesen and excellent Bavarian foods.

We got the daily specials  -

HB Brewmaster Combo 
Fried bratwurst schnitzel and a sausage kabob in BBQ onion sauce served with mashed potatoes and cole slaw.

She brought out our beers. Hofbrau Hefeweizens. Beer was good but nothing special when you can find good beer pretty much anywhere nowadays. Pretzel was a pretzel. A couple of jarred sauces for dipping. No big whoop. 

After we finished the waitress came back and was really pushing us to buy gift shop merchandise which I declined. She got all butt hurt like I killed her cat. Sorry, not into pressure from a waitress. 

Funny thing is, before we sat down I was looking at the t shirts in the gift shop. I would have probably bought one if the waitress hadn't tried to shove one down my throat.

First of all the atmosphere here is amazing.  You are swept into a huge hall adorned with long tables where you are seated among strangers - who you will soon become best friends with!! Clinking your beer filled steins and singling along to the live music.  Simply amazing.

It doesn't stop there!  The food is phenomenal.  Start off with a homemade pretzel with their various dipping sauces, you'll be glad you did.  It's enough to share - especially if you want room for more beer and your main course.

I had the Schnitzel Wiener Art, a breaded pork cutlet with cranberry (on the side) and a side dish of bavarian potato salad.  Delicious - portion is huge!!! I ate a good half and enjoyed every last bite.

When we went to check out she was all flustered and confused. She didnt know who ordered what?! At one point she said the more bills you want the longer it will take. Come on, every resturant can seperate their bills, what is the big deal! We asked for the manager several times. But he did nothing to help when he came to our table. Not sure we were really dealing with the manager. The waitress kept lying to the so called manger saying we all said it was okay to do one bill. During all this we kept being ingnored so she could help her new tables. When she needed to finish with us. I finally told my friends and family just leave your cash and lets go. Some people paid and left. Than my husbands parents got their bill for $200 bucks when they only ordered 2 pretzels and a meal. They were trying to bill them for peoples food that already left. So again I told them leave cash for the correct amount and lets leave. My best friend ended up yelling at the so called manager as we left telling him we know the bill is $200 but that is not correct and you need to get it right.

When she brought the shots she brought them to our table and tried to spank them on our table cause there was a giant pole in the way. One of the guys grabbed her and she smacked his hand away and he got in her face. She tried to make the situation better. Giving them different options on where to get spanked but he was so mad she pushed him off he just screamed in her face.

Hofbrauhaus is the quintessential rowdy restaurant where you can get some tasty beers and good eats.  I always find myself here in a party-type situation; mostly of the birthday type.  Honestly, the atmosphere fits and doesn't disappoint!

They have a live band playing both American and German folks songs while you get your drink or grub on and it keeps the lively atmosphere going.  As for the beer, they have 1/4, 1/2, and full liter mugs available depending on your thirst level.  IMO the best time to come in and funnel some beer into your gullet is around Oktoberfest.  Their Oktoberfest beer is awesome and highly recommended.  But, in the ""off-season"", the dunkel and hefe do just fine.

I've only had a few dishes here but I usually gravitate toward the veggie options.  They have a few veggie items available including the veggie brautwurst that comes complete with sauerkraut and mashed potatoes.  I've also tried the chicken braut here and they're similar enough to go either or, really.  The side salad is a healthy sized plate as well so if you're looking for something a little smaller to snack on, the side is a good option.  Also, before I forget, the soft pretzel here is really nice.  It's especially nice when it's fresh out and pieced off with a dab of the cheese or mustard sauce 'shmeared' on.. yummyyy.  Pro tip: alternate sauces when going in on the pretzel... trust me, it's a good time.

It wasn't complete crap but I expected better. I ordered a plate consisting of two white sausages and a Bavarian pretzel. Knowing a little about German culture I was expecting manly sized portions. Boy was I wrong. I received two tiny sausages. The average bratwurst one buys at a local grocery store dwarfs these lame tiny links. The taste was okay but nothing special at all. At least I had my fresh Bavarian pretzel to look forward too. Wrong again! It was a decent size but it tasted like it had been sitting in a freezer all week long and had just been popped into a microwave for a minute before being served. I was expecting a large warm fresh soft pretzel. I received a room temperature, stale pretzel that tasted like crap.pretzel time or auntie m's would destroy this place in a pretzel competition. Over all, I am never going back to this sad excuse for a restaurant. If I want good food and beer I'm going to the Chicago brewing company. I feel that real German people would be ashamed of this place.",negative
ch174,3/24/2014,revch129,1,"This place was quite a disappointment. I'm a Vegas local and after many years of driving past this place, finally decided to eat here. Made a reservation for 10pm and got there a bit late. We were told that the bar and kitchen was closing the moment we got there so we had to order quickly. Everything was rushed and the place was pretty much empty. Guess the staff really hates staying late. Food was okay, but nothing spectacular. Our pretzel was hard as a rock. Almost inedible. I got this sausage sampler and most of the sausages were cold and tough and one had a bone fragment in it. The busser came and cleaned off our table before we had completely finished eating..extremely rude. We were told they were closing in 10 minutes and they made our dessert to-go. Overall, not the best experience regardless of whether or not it was before close. You don't want people coming in late, don't allow them to make reservations and then rush them through eating. I now consider this place a tourist trap and would not recommend it to locals. Food was overpriced and lackluster.",negative

Very overpriced, we ordered one combo platter one cheese spaetzl dish, 2 deserts to go ($10 each) and 1 cocktail and soda. Total was almost $90. Another negative, This place is listed as good for kids and I must say that even with my 7 & 9 yr old who love to be around music and noise, but this place is unbearably loud. Can't even talk to one another or hear the waitresses, and I'm not exaggerating either. My kids looked like they were drowning in the noise, both were slumped in their seats almost falling asleep because of the disturbing noise of drunkenness surrounding this large room of hoorah and screaming. You literally feel trapped. Women were being spanked with paddles by the employees, while men cheered on. I wish I could say I enjoyed some kind of aspect here since I insisted on going here and really looked forward to the experience, but instead I felt like a horrible mother and completely ripped off. Never again.

Throw on your finest lederhosen and leave grandma at home.",positive
ch174,3/15/2014,revch132,1,"I was really looking forward to trying this place and when I finally did, I was disappointed. First things first, the food was average and expensive for what they offer. Granted this is a tourist spot, so the pricing is to be expected. I wouldn't recommend taking your kids here. This is basically the ""German experience"" of drinking and having fun with a little food thrown in. The beer hall smells terrible, like stale beer and sweat. Gross.

Now, on to the more important item. The service was so-so and my waiter tried to cheat me when we paid the bill. If you read nothing else in this review, read this - NEVER leave a cash tip if paying by card at this place! I charged our dinner, but left a cash tip and the waiter chased us down in the parking lot saying that he accidentally charged our card twice. This was a complete lie because while he went back inside with my card, I checked my bank app and it showed the exact amount I signed for on the receipt. He came back out a few minutes later and we went on our way. The next day I checked the bank and noticed the charge from the HB was for a higher amount and NOT the amount I signed for on the receipt. I called the HB and spoke to a very nice young lady in the accounting department who handled this whole mess after the fact. I sent her a copy of my signature and what do you know, it did not match the receipt. Hence, this waiter assumed I was a tourist visiting Las Vegas and not a resident, and he figured he could just steal from me and I wouldn't do anything about it. He took my generous cash tip and then tried to steal more money from me by charging my card for an second tip. It took nearly TWO WEEKS of my calling the HB to get the amount that I was owed refunded to me. This waiter committed fraud and, at the very least, should have been FIRED. That didn't happen. They told me that they've never had problems with him. Yeah, well, just because actual tourists don't complain when they sober up doesn't mean it isn't happening. He tried to steal from me and he'll try to steal from you too.

My overall suggestion is to avoid this place, but if you feel you just have to have the experience, pay with cash only.",negative
ch174,3/11/2014,revch133,4,"The Hofbrauhaus can provide a ""guten nacht"" for everyone if you want to go to a great German themed restaurant. However, expect to pay for it!

Having been to the actual Munchen Hofbrauhaus and I can tell you the decor is quite similar. Big long oak tables, a boisterous band of German singers, and more beer than you should be drinking. 

The food while not absolutely authentic ""best German food ever"", I do think that it provides enough of an idea of what German food looks and tastes like for the curious patron. 

This particular night that I went, the ""haus"" had a really fun young band of German singers who really knew how to get the crowd into the night. There was drinking songs, blowing the alpine horn game, and drunken dancing. What else do you want from a German restaurant?

The one problem with Hofbrauhaus is the fact that its more like a ""tourist spot"". You just go there not for the food, but for the experience and the ""I just went to Germany feeling"". While I recommend everyone to go once. Going on a regular basis probably means you don't care about money, or you're an alcoholic.

I'm giving them 2 stars since they did have vegetarian options (and tasty curry on fries), but their soft pretzels were not good (huge bummer, I live for pretzels), a bit dry and kind of ""meh.""

ch174,3/2/2014,revch138,5,"My wife and I went here back in January and had a great time.  We went kind of early so is wasn't packed or extremely loud like some reviewers have posted.  The atmosphere overall was nice,  we were seated at a table by ourselves since it wasn't very crowded at the time.

My wife ordered Hofbrauhaus Wurstplatte (Sausage Platter) and I got the Schnitzel Wiener Art (breaded Veal cutlet) and we shared for some variety.  Both plates were delicious,  we would have devoured it all but the servings were big so there was some food left over. 

The beer was good and cold, we both ordered the large mug (I think it was a liter).  I participated in a beer chugging contest for a free mug and came in 2nd out of 10.  No free mug but it was free to participate. 

There was not a band playing while we were there but there was a solo guy providing some entertainment,  he also coordinated the chugging contest.

If you order any shots, prepare to get swatted with a paddle.  Not sure if they do that in Germany or not but it was funny for everyone else to see and drew their attention when it cracked.

The only down side to this place was the location.  It was off the main strip so far, probably took us 20-30 minutes to walk each direction.  Not a big deal as we needed the exercise anyway after trying to eat all that food, would consider taking a taxi next time.

2. Great German food!!
3. Awesome entertainment in the form of German band, host with the most, paddling on the butt, beer drinking contest, etc!!!

I have been here several times, and have never been disappointed. If you are looking for a fun, casual and random night out, do try this little gem! It is especially fun on Saturdays, as they pull out all the stops with their live entertainment, that often includes getting patrons off their butts and on tables and chairs singing together while waving their steins. The food is enjoyable and hearty and the beers are great! I'm obviously not German so I can't say how authentic the food is, but i still think it's yummy. This place is obviously full of clichés and is most likely not what the real Munich is like, but all that matters to me is that I always leave smiling from ear to ear. 

I actually booked a few tables here for about  thirty five guests the night before my wedding. The staff took great care of us. My friends loved all the excitement and the preselected catered orders were a feast. Totally worth the money! Many of my friends have gone on to take their friends and spread the word on this place.

One main reason why will be writing this place off: when I went to pay the bill, I was informed there would be an extra fee of about 3% if I wanted to use my credit card.  According to Visa's rules this is supposed to be displayed at the entrance and printed on each Receipt.  I didn't notice anything at the entrance and it definitely isn't on the receipt.

I was a little worried about sound and saltiness from other reviews but neither were an issue. The entertainment was perfect and perfect volume. We tried 6-7 different dishes and fell in love with all of them (with the exception of the pot roast which was a little tough, but when we asked to sample some pork roast because we were trying to decide buffet options, the chef complied and it was amazing!)

The server, Olga?, was awesome! We had a couple of our party paddled for ordering shots and it was so much fun! The entire hall gets in on the fun! (And it was kind of nice that they don't do the whole...we're gonna get hot women to do paddling...it's normal servers with an awesome attitude!)

Being an avid yelper, I decided to read up on some reviews. 
After reading the reviews, I was a little nervous about going, to be honest.  I was really worried that  I wouldn't like any of the food...especially after reading the menu...I'm not really big on pork products, and there is a lot of pork on the menu. lol

So...we got there, and walked in, and were seated...
What a HUGE hall!  
At first, I was uncomfortable...it felt like it was a million and a half degrees in that place.  Oddly enough, the more I ate and drank, the better I felt. ;)

The atmosphere here is definitely one of carefree partying.  
Its loud.  There is lots of singing, music, shouting, chanting, and spanking.
I had a blast.

I personally did not have any shots...something about being spanked by a stranger with a paddle is not super appealing to me.  Maybe in the bedroom with someone I know, but not in public...those ladies looked pretty strong too. :)

Now onto what was ordered:

Beer:
I ordered the Hefeweizen, which was awesome.  The half liter was $8...it lasted me the whole time we were there, so it was a good value, but...I'm a slow beer drinker.  The other beers were really good too.  (I tasted everyone's.)

Food:
I ordered:
A pretzel:  Pretty good.  Salty, but not overly so.  
The potato pancakes with smoked salmon:  THIS was delicious.  I'm a sucker for potato pancakes, but there were divine.  The salmon was delicious, and the presentation was great.  (I'll upload a picture as soon as I can.)
German Potato Soup:  This was DELICIOUS!  My favorite of the night. :)
The Majoram/ (Veal sausages):  Since I'm not a big fan of pork products, I had intended on getting fish or chicken...but when I saw that there were veal sausages for the same price as the chicken...I opted for those.  They were tasty.  2 sausages served over mashed potatoes, with a red cabbage sauerkraut.  (I wasn't a fan of the red cabbage.)

All in all the quality of the food was good.  
However...
Between myself and my roommate, we spent $85 on 3 beers, two entrees, and two small starters.  
I could have eaten better food for half that cost elsewhere, but all in all, for a fun night out for a friend's birthday, it was a fun place to go.",positive

I've tried a good amount of food here on a couple of occasions, and I think it's just the German cuisine that I don't have the palate for...Don't get me wrong, the food is good and enjoyable, but nothing really stands out to me.  Come here for the drinks and the atmosphere!

I'd recommend trying the Fresh Baked Pretzel to start. Love it! All the dipping sauces were great too...and this thing is huge!  Very sharable...

I've tried most of the Sausages, Potatoes, Spatzl and Sauerkraut. My favorites were definitely the sausages and potatoes!  They all have unique tastes...but no extraordinary items to touch base.

And definitely try their Hofbrauhaus Hefeweizen. It is outstanding!

When I received my entree, we both kind of looked at my plate and my friend acknowledged before I could say anything that it was indeed a hot dog that had been placed on my plate instead of a German sausage as advertised.

I ended up tossing the hot dog at the wall.

This place will definitely satisfy your desires if you're wanting to experience a bunch of loud, annoying drunk people pretending they're in Germany. What's that? Oh, you have a giant glass boot filled with beer? You better chug that down as fast as you can without breathing!

I bet this place has to employ a full-time barf cleaner for all the times people drink themselves sick, not to mention the people who throw up after finding out they ate an Oscar Meyer hot dog filled with chicken beaks and pig assholes.

And as I recall, the entree was rather expensive. You can save yourself a lot of money and have the same meal if you just go to the supermarket, buy a pack of hot dogs, warm them up in the microwave and dip them in mustard.

However what made him even better was that he was having people play quarters for prizes, having contests for free beers (I won one, but was about to drive to LA and thus couldn't drink it) and I am sure he has many other things of a similar nature that I missed since we were there at lunch on a Sunday.

Pro Tip: I know Oktoberfest is going to be awesome here. Bavarian brau haus... ohhh yeah...

The murals, architecture, beer are all authentic. The food is a bit off though to me. I ordered the Oktoberfest Bratenteller. This is a double dish sauerbraten and pork roast. They each had a different gravy. The sauerbraten comes with a dark brown gravy with a slightly sour note due to the vinegar marinade that it left in for a few days. The meat is tenderized due to the marinating process and is done well. However the taste of the gravy seemed off to me. The pork roast was in a traditional German mushroom gravy. The pork was also tender but the taste wasn't on point to me again. It seemed that the gravy again wasn't like I am used to for most German food.  The pork roast mushroom gravy was also a much lighter shade than I am used to. However what had me crushed as that the spätzle wasn't that good. Spätzle is my most favorite part of German food. It is a noodle that when smothered in gravy is phenomenal. However here I felt it was anything but. =\   

Pro Tip #2: Most of the items in the gift shop are a weee bit overpriced ;)   so unless money is no object, I bet you can find that stuff cheaper elsewhere.

Service was kind of funky as well. The fraulein who was serving us, was somewhat inattentive and missed some basic things that the other waitresses did not. The details are what will make or break ya, and she forgot to ask if we wanted straws or lemon in our water when every other table had them delivered that way. She had a preoccupied air and was almost mentally checked out it seemed. 

Pro Tip #3: If you sign up for their online newsletter (on their website), you get free beer coupons!

Overall, I would come here for the bier, camaraderie, German culture, drinking songs... Heard the pretzels were good as well, but the grub perhaps would be better on a different day/night or perhaps I ordered the wrong item. I also disliked that we got there during lunch time and didn't receive a lunch menu but a dinner menu =\",negative
ch174,12/16/2013,revch169,4,"FUN!!! Although we went at a time when it was a little dead in there, we made our own party. We ordered one of their beers n it was damn fine. 
Got to listen to the polka band I believe(?).  Had drinks n enjoyed ourselves. Our server was very nice as was everyone in the place. 
We ordered the schnitzel and I was amazed at how crazy sounding it was-it was delish! Was just pork, breaded n fried. Came with a sweet, tangy plum sauce.

You sit at long tables with other people so be prepared to make friends.  The food is kind of expensive but it is good.

I have sat in the front hall and in the back and both have poor service. The guy yolding, singing, dancing, and so forth, was semi entertaining, but not enough to make me like the place. I am German, I love beer, but this place did not satisfy my taste buds, beer and food wise. I tried everyone dish too, because I hated mine (chicken sausage) and I did not like any of them.

ch174,11/23/2013,revch177,5,"The Hofbräuhaus remains a great place to spend a few hours over lunch. German beer, sausages, and other yummy treats make it a good place to cure a Las Vegas hangover. Go sit down at the Oktober-style benches and enjoy treats you would only get in Munich itself.  On weekends you find Bavarian style entertainment, which consists of a man-show showing off odd skills like blowing a 20 feet long Alphorn. The place transforms any crowd into a huge party tent in the middle of the day. Recommendation to guys: Make sure you try the Jaegermeister / Butt Paddle action: You get a shot of herb-based liquor with a nice spanking from a busty waitress in a Dirndle outfit all in front of everybody.",positive

Not only are the food prices high, but the food itself isn't very good. The portion sizes are crazy small for what you pay for. They have a house band at night that plays old American tunes and they are horrible. If you're looking for good German beer and food, then look elsewhere. The only thing going on here is the raping of your wallet for sub par food.",negative
ch174,11/17/2013,revch179,5,"First of all, if you don't have a taste for German food then you shouldn't even be here. If you go to the one in Munich, it's pretty much the same food...with less history of course.

My family would come here for dinner and always have a good time. So, I chose this place for a work event. We had 350 attendees and reserving the Biergarten through Karen was easy-breezy. Our numbers kept changing but it wasn't a problem. We were well taken care of and everyone had fun. The service was outstanding. We had so much food that we had to take food home.

I personally like their schnitzel and spatzl...and of course their lager and hefeweizen. For dessert, I like their Kirschtort (Black Forest cake).

Take a shot of Jaegermeister and get paddled in public. Good times! Consider the following before setting up an event/ having a huge group here as there are fees if you: use their microphone, bring balloons, put an announcement/marquis, etc.",positive
ch174,11/11/2013,revch180,1,"I've been living in Vegas for a while and have been told to come here a couple times. I was invited to a birthday party here on a Saturday night and did not enjoy myself. We arrived and had a drink at the bar. Finally we went into the main room. There is a band in a very echoey room playing horrible versions American music. It is packed. Every table is full of drunk people. Every table was super packed... They seriously pack the people in here. I'm pretty sure they would fail if the fire Marshall came in. I couldn't get thru most of the 'walkways'. They just put a table in the middle of the walkway if the table wants to fit more people. 

So we finally order and our food isn't very good. I guess this place is all about the beer and loudness. Basically you squeeze into the booth and are touching everyone around you while screaming to have a conversation or order. You are listening to HORRIBLE music. Then you eat food that is not good and pay too much for it all! 

I will not be back!",negative
ch174,11/8/2013,revch181,5,"This place has been on my list to visit for a few years now and I finally made it over... I wish I had explored it sooner.

It's been too long for me to remember the real Hofbrauhaus in Munich, Germany for comparison, but I sure felt like I was in a German beer hall.  The restaurant is divided into two dining areas.  The first is an open Beer Hall with large tables.  Perfect for larger groups.  Six of us were at a table with plenty of room to spare.  The second area is a Beer Garden which has smaller tables and more for a quiet(er) meal.   There's also a bar at the front of the building.  The Beer Garden seemed to be closed for a party when I was there.

There's a band playing upbeat German style music. As other reviews mentioned, there's barmaids walking around with shots and will give you a paddling you haven't felt since you were in Junior High!  (Well, for those of us old enough to have been spanked before the world became soft and sensitive.)  This place was hopin' on a Tuesday night.  No... I didn't get paddled.

The food was definitely close to being authentic German dishes.  It may not be something everybody can appreciate (like how some people can't stand Chinese, sushi or Mexican), but the flavor and quality was good.  The food ranges from snacks/appetizers perfect for simply wanting to have a night of drinking.  There is a variety of dishes if you want a meal.   I was happy with what I ate.  

Now to the beer.... this is a GERMAN BEER HALL.  Go away if you're looking for Miller,  Coors or some fru-fru status symbol.  They only have German style beer here.  The selection is limited to several different beers, and they were all good.  

If you're looking for a quiet, dull time where you can enjoy meaningful conversation and eat Americanized versions of another culture's food, then go someplace else.  If you're looking for a place with higher energy to have fun and experience something different, then this is a good place to try.

Hofbrauhaus is on my short list of must-visit places whenever I return to Vegas.",positive
ch174,11/6/2013,revch182,5,Loved it! Great sausage appetizers. Good drinks. The steak came with a crazy gravy with unreal mashed potatoes - thought I was going to pop I was so full. Quality food. Rowdy atmosphere so be prepared. Went with a group of 50 do it took 2 hours to get served but we were all drunk by then and the staff is liberal with giving the paddle to eager participants. Good experience overall. If u want fine dining this is not for you.,positive

ch174,11/4/2013,revch184,4,"Always a good time. 1L beer steins are $15, which on the expensive side, but good strong beer. Food isn't great, but descent. Wide variety if sausages. We had some big pretzel thing with couple of mustards and a cheese dip thing. Chicken sausage was pretty good. Didn't really eat much. Oktoberfest beer was good, Hefeweizen was good as well. The spankings hurt less after a few liters if beer.",positive
ch174,11/4/2013,revch185,4,"Now before anyone jumps on me about this is not a true beer hall or something like that, I too have visited the Hofbtauhaus in Munich Germany and though I was in Las Vegas this beer hall did bring back some very thoughtful memories. The beer hall is painted very similar to its German patriarch and the smell of German cooking filled the air. I started off with a 0.5l dunkle as did my wife and we ordered a sausage sampler. The order came with potato salad, sauerkraut and a pair of pretzels. With the exception of the pretzels which were well overcooked the meal was a great sampling of food. Half way through eating an entertainer arrived playing traditional German music and did a great job getting the crowd involved. We decided to order another round, this time I ordered 1.0l helles, and stayed to enjoy the show. We both had a lot of fun singing and raising our mugs. If you are looking for an escape from all the loud Las Vegas bars and restaurants and want a truly unique experience visit the Hofbtauhaus you will not be disappointed.",positive

Here's why I gave them the full 5 star rating. It's so freaking awesome. When you enter the building you wait in relaxing lobby area where there's a very nice wooden bar with selves filled glass mugs and a fridge filled with beer bottles and kegs, the small ones. There's even a gift shop. Now when youre ready to go in the doors open up and there's a loud roar of craziness. People shouting, cheering, singing, dancing, and laughing. Glass mugs were all up in the air. The whole atmosphere felt like the movie Beerfest but without the teams and Miss Yeast. You sit at these large wooden table that probably fit 20. You order beer served in a 1 liter glass mugs, a plastic shoe, or a smaller glass cup. You order shots from your server and they bring them out in a wooden stick,  very nice looking but watch out cause that stick duals as a whacking paddle. There's also another girl dressed in black going around serving shots in test tubes, she'll really whack you. There's a guy going round looking for girls to hold his very long horn while he plays it. There's a few guys up in the front leading the cheers.

Drinks aren't cheap and food is reasonably priced. Their giant pretzels weren't that giant but came with cheese, mustard, and another dipping sauce. I saw some plates of cutlet and sausages looked nice in portions. Located across the Hard Rock Hotel on Harmon and Paradise, a busy and dangerous intersection for people who stumble out so watch out for your friends. Gather up a dozen or so people and have good time, make new friends there. We need a Yelp event here LOL.",positive
ch174,11/2/2013,revch187,3,"Uhhh....My friends dragged me here for lunch (they both went to the original restaurant in Germany, so they wanted to revisit their experience at my expense). Being in a city with such amazing food options, we came here and I am not too thrilled when I reflect upon it. 

I don't drink, so I was not enticed by the massive beers they give. The lemonade I had was horrible. I could taste the syrup and I felt as if I was drinking lemon flavored cough syrup. The food was heavy and not good by any means. I ordered a chicken sandwich, but I tried the more traditional meals my friends ordered. Not happy with either. 

The only upside was the one man band and the occasional spankings when people would buy shots. My buddy was spanked really HARD and in some way I believe it was the universal paying him back for bringing me here.

Place is loud, can barley have a conversation,(which is okay if your wasted)
The seating is very crowded, more than a few times all of us at our party bumped in tot he table behind us and like wise.

The drinks ( mixed drinks were really weak) I tasted from friends drinks,
and worst off the food was ridiculously salty.

The pretzel that came our needed a glass of water per bit/ or dipped in the hotter mustard sauces to mask the saltiness.

the food was also extremely salty, and this was for about 4 of the 8 guys that ate with us. many of us got the jager dish( that was way to salty)


I threw up after a few bites of pretzel and two bites of the jager sausage plate from too much salt( I am sure its the salt since I didnt drink any alcohol the whole day)





The only good that came out of going was the decor, and the fact you get to see some people get smacked so hard on their moneymakers they cry

I don't care what the acoustics in the building are, you can get sound that can be heard!

The band sounds good, but whenever a person speaks into the microphone it sounds so muffled and garbled its impossible to understand. If they correct that, the atmosphere will be even more party-like and would get much greater participation from customers. As it is, only a couple of tables nearest the stage can understand because they are closest to the stage monitors which are clear and crisp.

It would be nice if everyone, especially those who answer the phone, and the hostesses are informed of what is going on.

I planned to compete in their ""Octoberfest"" competition and even brought seven friends to cheer me on. We had dinner and drinks, but when it came time for the contest, management said they didn't know why it had happened at an earlier time than scheduled.

I had called and checked first for the times, checked their website, and even looked in the newspaper that they put on my table! All three sources had confirmed they have two contests per night on Fridays and Saturdays.

My friends and I left very disappointed, more from management's total lack of customer service than anything else. They did nothing to even attempt to make it right, they just made excuses and blamed others.

Yes, you heard that right. There are German Mistresses here with paddles, like those wooden ones you see that were meant spanking school girls. The mistresses wear the same exact uniform as the rest of the front staff, so I don't know if SHE was gonna spank me, the HOST was gonna spank me, or the BARTENDER was gonna grab the paddle and get wild on me.

So I asked the guy serving me food and drink, ""Is it normal?"", and he told me it's somehow related to taking shots of Jagermeister that involves being paddled.

ch185,11/30/2014,revch205,4,"I have been a fan of Raising Cane's ever since I first tried them at a booth at Bite of Las Vegas back in 2007. It is a blessing and a curse that this particular location is in the same shopping center as my work. It is amazing to see how much this business has grown. I remember when there were only 2 locations and now there are 7! It is no surprise considering that the food is so good. The menu is so basic, but it packs a little punch. The selection is variable, but a basic combo contains chicken fingers, fries, texas toast, coleslaw, and dipping sauce. 

The chicken is always cooked to perfection. (Except for during my last visit when it was overdone, but that was Black Friday and they were busy, so I guess I'll overlook that this time.) There is also a chicken sandwich available. It's just a sandwich with chicken tenders tucked inside. 

The crinkle cut fries are a little bland, but a little ketchup can always help that. Their texas toast is freaking amazing! A little crispy around the edges, soft and buttery in the middle. I'm not a big fan of coleslaw, so whenever I order, I always replace my coleslaw with an extra slice of texas toast. And that is the beauty of this place! If you find that you don't like something, you can always replace it with something else! 

The Cane's sauce is unlike any other dipping sauce I have ever tried. It kind of looks like thousand island, but the flavor is hard to explain. I have always loved it, but if you're not a fan, they have honey mustard available.

Most places around town offered a free meal to military and veterans or a discount on the entire bill, I guess Cain's is appreciative but just not as much as the rest of the U.S.

I found out while doing their survey that they have a Caniac Club, a Cain's member card which I nor my daughter's bf have ever been told about and he goes there like 3 times a week.  I guess that boils down to the staff and the management at the place, it is just not something they push.

Anyway, the food is good, they do screw up the orders from time to time in the drive thru, not sure how they manage that but they do.  I have complained about this location to the manager twice about not getting what I ordered in the drive thru and they treat you like you are lying.

It definitely wasn't bad, just didn't live up to the hype. Pretty good sauce, nice tenders, standard fries, and alright toast. My dinner was lacking a wow factor. But I'll give it another go the next time I'm in town just to make sure it just wasn't an off night.",negative

ch185,10/29/2014,revch212,3,"This is an interesting place. I'm from Southern California and we don't have Raising Canes there. However, I'm a big fan of chicken fingers so my boyfriend took me here. I'm only giving it 3 stars for the following reason... when I was ordering, I asked the waitress to tell me about the secret sauce. I'm picky about my sauces. I prefer ranch and honey mustard so I was just asking her about it. Her response was well it's a secret sauce so I can't tell you what's in it. I didn't ask what's in it. I wanted to know is it spicy, mild, creamy? That pissed me off so I was in a bad mood by the time I got my food. I don't appreciate getting attitude from a 17 year old kid. It was my first time there. I was just asking a question. My food was good, but the girl at the counter ruined the moment for me with her attitude.  If you love chicken fingers like I do, then I recommend this place if you're in the area. Just don't expect fabulous service.",negative

The food was ready quickly and I waited at the counter rather than have the kid bring the plastic trays to the table.  During this time, I got the two iced teas we would have.

The food was very hot and it was good.  I'd been to Raining Cane's before and I knew what to expect.  I got a refill of my iced tea before we left.

My only complaint was they level of air conditioning.  Damn it was cold in there.  

Cane's is a now and then kind of thing.  A drawback is it's very family friendly and the sometimes loud, howling youngsters detract from the meal.",negative
ch185,10/11/2014,revch215,5,"I swear every time I go to Raising Cane's I think the workers hate me, because I always put in complicated orders that don't need to be complicated. The first time I asked for just a few chicken strips, without fries and just the coleslaw and texas toast. When it would have been much easier to just order on of their pre-set menus. The second time I asked for a party tray of chicken strips and a few cups of coleslaw and texas toast, and again it would have been easier to order one of their preset menus. Sorry Raising Cane's! I need to read your menu next time.

but seriously though, that FRIED CHICKEN, TEXAS TOAST, and the SAUCE. SO GOOD.",positive
ch185,10/11/2014,revch216,4,"Fried chicken, special sauce, tasty Texas-toast style bread, and crinkle-cut fries.

If you can't get down with that, well, I don't know what to tell you, but Cane's delivers. 

Always hot and tasty, crispy, yet also moist and juicy - the Cane's way of chicken strips is one of the BEST. Add to this the tasty, slightly salty, crinkle-cut fries and you have a winning combo.

This Cane's in particular is a busy and tends to be a tourist magnet as it is on LV Blvd and next to the Outlet Mall. However, even when it is packed, customer service is not lacking.

If you want some chicken strips that you know will be good and you don't mind going to a chain, Cane's is always a good bet.",positive
ch185,10/5/2014,revch217,4,"How do they make the chicken here?

I always assumed it was magic because I have never had a bad chicken strip here. The consistency in the chicken is superb. It's always very moist. The menu is basically Chicken strips, more chicken strips, and a chicken strip burger. You won't find variety here unfortunately. The Texas Toast that they have here is also very good and very popular. It's a big, fat, soft, buttered piece of toast they provide with every meal (except the kids meal, and the burger, I believe). The french fries are nothing too special and the coleslaw is decent, although I always tend to substitute it for an extra piece of toast at no extra charge! I believe the sweet tea and lemonade is made in-house and very good. I don't remember the last time I haven't had the sweet tea here.

With this location in particular, you may find it VERY packed if you come at the wrong time. I believe since it's closest to the strip, and a lot of tourists have heard about this place. You might be waiting a while and scouting for a table. They have a drive through, but you might be waiting a bit as well if the line gets pretty long.

Prices are fairly reasonable, ranging from $7-$10 depending on how many chicken strips you want and how big the drink is with the combo.

I would stop and try this if you haven't been to a Canes before. This is a big favorite for locals here in Las Vegas. Everybody that I bring here for their first time ends up being addicted and finds themselves back here sooner than later!",positive

Walking inside there were tons of people and the line was fairly long but it being right by the outlets could be why it was crowded, just saying lol. The menu wasn't very big, it was quite limited. I expected more variety and more side dishes. I ordered a 3 strip combo which came with fries, bread and special sauce. The chicken was good don't get me wrong but it just didn't blow me away like I thought it would. The strips had a crispy crust which is always a plus, the fries were mediocre nothing special. The special sauce looked like thousand island dressing kind of but it sure didn't taste like it, can't explain the taste but it was a bit peppery but very good. Now the bread was my favorite part of the meal, it looked like it was a grilled hot dog bun of some sort. It was buttery and had a hint of garlic, it was so good!

Affordable pricing 
Texas toast and chicken fingers, dipping sauce  are good.
Below are my reason for giving only 2 stars to this fast food chain:
Chicken tastes fresh when you eat hot. So don't wait until you get home.
There are lot of school kids , when I went there. Could not really enjoy my food between those screams and shouts. Very noisy. 
Iced tea tastes good , often wonder how much sugar they might have used to make tea taste so sweet. Well if you are health conscious then stay away from the drink.",negative

I never really complained because that's how I thought it was supposed to be but then I went to the location on rainbow & it was amazing!! The chicken was a lot bigger & they put a lot of fries in my box. I was stuffed by the end of the meal & it was worth every dollar.

If you ask for unsweetened it's like they don't care, they just give you what they want in the drive thru.  I really don't understand how you can screw up unless you just don't care enough about your job and the customers you are serving.

I don't like giving bad reviews but this is twice now.  Last time it was the number of pieces were shorted, tonight the drink order was wrong.  Is this what things are coming to, you have to double check the drive thru window.  You only handle one ticket at as time going out the window it really should not be that hard to pay attention to detail.

Was looking for something quick to eat, but didn't want to go to any of the fast food chains we have here in LA.  I decided to check out Raising Cane's since it got good Yelp reviews.  Not having paid much attention, I realized after I entered that it's a chicken strips place.  Not really knowing what was best, I decided to order their most popular meal:

The Box Combo

I wasn't quite sure what Cane's Sauce was so I was game and decided to try it.  Had to get Sweet Tea with my combo and a little taste of the South that I like to indulge in when I can.

My order was to go and I dove right in after returning to my hotel.  The chicken strips were a little different than what I would expect from a fast food place, even a diner-like restaurant such as Denny's.  I could immediately tell these were white-meat pieces of chicken.  The batter wasn't anything special, but I appreciate the fact that they don't use formed chicken.

The fries were crinkle-cut which is also different from any other fast food place I've tried.  The Texas toast was probably the best part of the combo.  It was very soft inside and just slightly toasted enough to create a ""skin"".  The cole slaw was pretty good, too.  Needless to say, I pretty much devoured the entire meal as I was fairly hungry.  The sweet tea was just sweet enough, but not overly so.

I would make a trip back to try some of the other combos, but as with most other fast food, I would probably choose a healthier place like Subway first.  The staff was incredibly friendly, though!",negative
ch185,5/15/2014,revch244,5,"Raising Cane's is the best thing ever and I love coming to this place. The food is by far amazing and I love how they are very fast and efficient with your order and service. I hear they are opening up one on St Rose Pkwy right by my house and I am super excited for that to happen. They have the best chicken tenders, in my opinion, and they have the best sauce as well. That Cane's sauce is to die for and I love using it with your chicken, Texas toast, and fries. You can't even beat their prices at all. They give you about four chicken tenders, fries, Texas toast and a drink for about $7. That is a pretty amazing deal to me!",positive
ch185,5/13/2014,revch245,5,BEST CHICKEN FINGERS IN VEGAS! I went here for lunch with my old friends and they make the best secret cane sauce.

It's also a great price. Absolutely love this place.

I love the Box Combo: four chicken fingers, a pile of crinkle-cut fries, coleslaw, Texas toast, and a drink. The famous Cane's dipping sauce is addictive and is a perfect accompaniment to the chicken fingers. Although I didn't care for the coleslaw, the fries and Texas toast were just fine.

If you are new, I suggest you get ""The Box Combo."" It includes all their goodies: 4 Chicken Fingers, a side of fries, coleslaw, their infamous Cane's sauce (which I think tastes like Thousand Islands with some seasoning), Texas Toast, and a drink of your choice. 
Also, if you've got a big appetite, I suggest you get ""The Caniac Combo."" It is exactly what it sounds: 6 Chicken Fingers, extra fries, coleslaw, 2 Cane's sauce, Texas Toast, and a large drink! They also have a kid's meal.

The chicken strip was flavorful, the fries weren't too salty, the bread was my favorite part of the meal, yummy! Also the canes sauce really is crack, make sure to put it on everything, yum!

The place gets a good crowd going constantly; every table was full at 3 pm, which I consider the non-peak hour.  The restaurant is pretty clean, too.

ch185,12/16/2013,revch274,4,Their chicken is to die for; delicious and moist. So yummy.  I'm not a fan of the toast like everyone else but its ok. Try combining the hot sauce in the canes sauce. Soooo good. :),positive

ch185,12/14/2013,revch276,5,"AWWWW YEHHHHHH IF YOU LOVE SOME CHICKEN FINGERS THEN THIS BE THE PLACE RIGHT HEREEEEEE.

The place size is average, but you don't really have to worry about finding a seat. A table usually opens up every few minutes. Just order at the counter and wait till they call you up!

To be honest the chicken fingers and fries aren't spectacular nothing really taste worthy. But their texas toast is what makes up for it. When that warm crunchy bread hits your lips and you take a bite out of it, you'll just know...that this is not game. I don't know how to describe the flavor but it's just so damn good! I also love love love getting their iced tea! It's always on point and if you have a sweet tooth this is the perfect drink to go with your hot meal ^^.

Pro tip! You can substitute any of the items in your order for another item! I usually exchange the coleslaw for another toast :)

If I could change anything about this place it'd be the prices for their cane sauce. They  charge so much for such a small sauce -__-",positive

First had it in their home state on Louisiana and was so excited to find that there are locations in Vegas. The service is always great. The sweet tea is a must. And theres nothing wrong with goin a little overboard and gettin a caniac! One recommendation, if your not high on coleslaw, with the box combo, you can change out the coleslaw for another Canes sauce.",positive

ch185,11/18/2013,revch280,4,I like this place. A little pricey. But it is way better than the other typical fried chicken places. The chicken looked like chicken and tasted like it too. Closes commercial chicken you will get if you dont want to make it yourself.,positive

It gets pretty busy at this location around 12 and on so get here early or possibly be prepared to wait around for a table. What can I say about Raising Canes but the fact that they have really great tasting chicken fingers. If there were a chick fil A nearby it could be a tough decision. 

The dining area is decent sized and they have movie posters, rebel memoribilia, etc as decor. Customer service was very friendly and at times they have promotions with UNLV sports.",positive

I love the crinkle cut fries but the styrofoam to go container they put them in tends to make all the food soggy by the time I get home. LOVE the texas toast!! Yummy, love this place!

Yay:
-Sweet tea: theirs is one of the best I've ever had! I like that they sell it by the jug.
-Chicken Fingers: moist, crispy, and juicy.  Nothing like a chicken nugget where it's a bunch of mushed up chicken parts.  You can tell it's real chicken. It wasn't oily either which is a huge plus. The combos come with coleslaw, fries, and texas toast. Yum!

Other:
-Fries: I love fries but I felt like theirs needs some kind of seasoning.
-Cane's sauce: I don't know what it is... I don't know if I like it or not but I think the chicken would have been good with ranch or gravy instead.",positive

ch185,10/2/2013,revch286,5,"5.0 STARS

Location Overview:
Although this is the ""closest"" location (still pretty far) for any Henderson Residence, it is well worth the drive. The location is in a good area. This Raising Canes is next to an outlet mall and other food places. The location is good. No bad area other than the highway which is about half a mile away. A little congested with traffic but decent movement.

Customer Service:
I have gone to this specific location numerous times and I have always had great customer service. The employees show nothing but courtesy welcomes and a good experience. 

Food Quality/Quantity:
The quality of this food has been more than perfect every time. I have never had any disappointing feelings towards the food quality at this location. Everything comes out hot and ready to eat. The quantity is more than enough. I have seen a 3 piece combo meal fill up a grown man and he is plenty full. 

Side Notes: It does take a little bit of extra time for the food to come out. This location is almost always busy with customers.",positive
ch185,9/24/2013,revch287,4,"went here on a sunday afternoon and it was crackin! 

I personally like KFC better for my friend chicken fix, but this place was decent. It's basically a fast food joint with the standard chicken fixins. cole slaw, fries, fried chicken, chicken burgers, chicken fingers, etc. 

BUT! they have this sauce that looks like thousand island mixed with something spicy. this sauce also may have crack in it because it's so damn good. the sauce makes their dishes awesome!",positive

1 star = for all the cool combos, 3 finger, the box, and even one with 6 fingers. Can't go wrong with these options w/ different hunger dependencies.

2 stars = crack sauce. I don't know what's in it, but it's bomb! Not too tangy!

ch185,9/17/2013,revch290,4,"Raising Cain is the ""In-N-Out"" of chicken fingers.  On many a trip to the outlet mall of Vegas, my wife and I always noticed a huge line up of cars at this place called Raising Cain.  So, this trip we decided we needed a carb fix and checked out the reviews on Yelp...and decided that this was the place we needed to finally visit.  Well the trip was worth it!  There are basically 4 selections to choose from and they range from a plate with 3 chicken fingers to 6...or a sandwich.  Fries and a drink included for a very reasonable price.  The chicken fingers are like nothing we have tried before...lightly breaded, deep fried, tasty and not greasy at all.  In fact after ordering ""The Box"" (4 chicken fingers, coleslaw, fries and a drink)...I really only needed one napkin.  My wife thought the chicken fingers were great but commented that the crinkle cut fries were more like the frozen fries you buy in a bag at the grocery store.  I have to agree...they were nothing special.  The much raved about dipping sauce was also very good.  A slight zing and mild black pepper taste added to the wonderful flavor of the chicken fingers.  The coleslaw was also tasty.  The restaurant was clean with ample seating...and the staff very friendly.  When we finally headed out the door a friendly staffer said to us, ""Bye and have a great day"".  How often does that happen these days.  The chicken fingers I rate a 5...but the fries lower my overall rating down to a 4.  Great place to go when you need a quick carb fix!  We will be back!",positive

ch185,8/19/2013,revch292,4,"This is a tradition go to spot for me and my friends everytime we go to vegas, for fast food this place REAL good! 

I always get the 3 piece chicken combo, it comes with 3 pieces of chicke (hence the name) french fries, and garlic bread....First things first....the chicken: best thing about the chicken is that the batter they use doesnt taste fattening, its a thin light batter with just the right amount of crunch too it. Next is the garlic bread: The garlic bread is a must get! Its got a nice fluff to it alongside a nice crisp on the outside.

One of the most important things to get is the dipping sauce! Its hard to explain what it tastes like but im gonna say its like a lightly peppered bbq mayo sauce with a hint of smokiness too it...its a must get when coming here. Id recommend getting extra if you wanna dip your fries, garlic bread, and chicken in it...which is what I do.",positive

We arrived during the peak lunch hours and the place was packed. Despite the long line, the cashiers got the line moving quite quickly and were busy bussing tables to get them cleared for new customers. I was really impressed by the good customer service and teamwork I witnessed at this location. 

We got our meals quickly and happily ate our chicken fingers while we chatted. I'm still not a huge fan of the food, but I do like the sauce and Texas toast they serve with it.

We were starving in Vegas and nobody wanted to go to a buffet...bastards.
So we drove down the boulevard and stopped at the mall lot to see what we could find. 
I was like, ""that place looks busy, we should go.""
Anyway, we went in and it was bustling. Not gonna lie, there was a ton of ghetto going on from a whole lot of directions.
But what can I say, I'm kinda hood too and maybe felt at home.
The register dude was nice. 
Ok...so it must be amazing cuz hood people know what's up with chicken right?
Well, not so much...honestly, it mostly tasted like floured chicken which I know that's what it is....but maybe add some flavor?
The fries were those crinkled fries that tasted like the ones we'd get in elementary school, not bueno.
The cane sauce, which they're stingy about, also not very good either.

The first time I had it, simply amazing.  Now that I've begun to eat a little healthier I find that i feel really full right after and than lose energy a few hours later.

I enjoy getting the sandwiches and the Cane's sauce is very unique and gives the chicken just a tiny kick.  For whatever odd reason I also think the ice cubes here are cool, well they aren't cubes but almost perfect circles or hail stones for your soft drink.

Raising Cane's gives you a reason to root for the Rebel's as you get a free ""Runnin Rebel"" combo if they win (so expect a lot of canes in the winter, not so many during fall football ;) )",negative

The things that popped out to me was one the sauce made everything dope...the freshness of the fried chicken fingers , and the toast. We don't have this in California so i wanted to jump at the chance to try it. 

It was good i have to admit..this is a spot if you're in a rush to get the funk out of dodge or  need a filler for one of your meals in the day or something to fill up your tummy from a night of galavanting in a city full of alcohol.

FYI: So you kind of know where I'm coming from...I really don't eat at any fast food places, some as long since 1998. Only reason why we were here was 1. Mr. B. is a fan of this place and  2. Everything in the proximity of the outlets were all fast food and 3. I'm fasting for Lent and it's was no red meat Friday.

I ordered the smallest combo offered which was 3 chicken fingers, fries and Texas Toast and all I could think was it was super starchy! Lucky Mr. B ordered the larger combo that included coleslaw.  Since he doesn't like coleslaw and I hardly eat bread, I made a trade.  His coleslaw for my Texas Toast! I think it was a good trade! The coleslaw was nice and cold and crunchy..the dressing was a bit runny though.   Since I limit my intake of starches, I skipped eating the fries too.  Not a fan of the crinkle cut type anyway.   Chicken was good though. Good sized and pretty meaty and the batter was perfect golden brown and didn't fall apart when you took a bite. 

This place was pretty small  but easily accommodated everyone even though it was pretty busy. Set up: order and pick up your food when it's ready kind of deal. The employees here though brought out the food to the tables when they had time to.  Also one assigned to bus tables so the place was pretty clean. This place is one of the better alternatives for fast food and I would eat here again if I had to.",negative

Batter often flakes off since it is light and just enough. Fries are thinner crinkle cut and crispy.

But the meal that we probably enjoyed the most (and was by far the least expensive!) was the quickie breakfast of chicken fingers and crinkle cut fries at 9am at Raising Cane's.  Chicken fingers and fries at 9am in the morning you ask?  HELL YEA!  You know that something was really good when you eat it and 3 hours later while driving down the freeway, you keep on thinking about how good it was!  Why don't we have chicken fingers like these in California?!!",positive

I don't know what's in it, but I will eat it on EVERYTHING - chicken, toast, fries.  Oh man oh man.  Parking kind of sucks since it's in a busy area and I have no experience with the drive-thru.

Sweet tea is overly sweet... I usually mix half sweet tea, half regular tea + a packet or two of Splenda.  Meh.

Service can be slow but at least the food is fresh.  Every now and again their chicken just tastes slightly off - I can't pinpoint why, perhaps different quality batches that come in - but the fries and toast are consistently good.

This location is kind of close to where I live, but not close enough to make it convenient.  Also, the boo isn't too fond of it so I don't really go here that often.  If I am ABSOLUTELY craving southern-type chicken and have some extra cash, I may venture this way.  That's a big ""may.""

Reading some of my other Vegas Yelp friend's reviews, I bookmarked this place in hopes I could talk Minh into going before we hit up the outlets, which by the way is in the same area as this place!

Don't look for anything fancy here; it's just a good ol' drive thru fast food joint. Except when you walk in ::drum roll:: its clean smelling and clean looking! All the employees are actually happy to be working and even greet you! 

Since we were having a late lunch, we decided to share a meal and went with ordering:

The Box Combo:
Four Chicken Fingers 
Fries 
Coleslaw 
Cane's Sauce 
Texas Toast 
Regular Drink

There is plenty of seating inside, we found a booth but wasn't 100% clean. Maybe we sat down too quick. An employee was walking by so I asked him if he would not mind cleaning out table. Instead of the rude yeah okay. He was nice about it and even said sorry that the tabletop was not totally clean. 

Our number was called and Minh went to go get our food. When he got back to the table, the box was huge. The smell was inviting and the taste was the best! The chicken tenders were lightly seasoned and juicy! I had a bite of the coleslaw and that was pretty darn good too! Texas toast was out of this world yummi (I paid dearly for it over the next couple of days since I cannot really eat bread anymore) but it was worth it! Light and buttery this toast was thick!

The Cain sauce had an interesting taste; it was a unique and went well with the fries (which were not oily) and the chicken strips!

Raising Cane's was built from a dream one guy had. When others turned him down for loan he didn't give up instead he hustled and built his dream on his own. Todd Graves story is amazing along with his dog who the business is named after!

ch185,1/8/2013,revch319,3,my friends were raving bout this place.. it was just ok for me.. the bread was fresh warm and not too sweet.. the chicken.. i admit it's better than kfc.. but we went back 3 times within 2 days!,negative
ch185,1/5/2013,revch320,3,"My review will strictly be on what I ordered:

The Box Combo - Shared this with a friend and it was the perfect amount.  I'll start with the chicken fingers.  Obviously freshly battered and fried which makes a huge difference in the overall quality of the product.  Moist, tender, crispy, and simply seasoned.  The Canes sauce goes heavy on the cracked pepper, which I didn't mind at all.  The fries will crinkle cut fries which I think are fitting to the type of meal that is being served.  The coleslaw was pretty standard and on the sweet side.  The toast well...... I mean who doesn't love a warm, crispy on the outside and fluffy on the inside thick piece of white bread with butter slathered on one side? YUM!

OVERALL:  Pretty good place for what it is.  You don't find places that focus on chicken fingers so it's a great alternative for those who aren't so much into the 93457203975209384 burger joints in this country.

ch185,9/5/2012,revch328,4,"On a recent Vegas trip with my friends, we all got to select an activity that everyone must go to or do.  Mine was to go to Raising Cane's because I like chicken fingers and the last time I had them was over a year ago.  

This Raising Cane's is located at the Las Vegas Outlets, so you can only imagine how crowded and busy it can be.  And if you think the one on Flamingo is a better bet, think again, it's just as crowded. We came during the lunch rush, it was also Labor Day too.  They also happened to have an event going on, a race car driver was there and they had a giveaway for a ride in his car.  I shared with my boyfriend, we ordered the Caniac which is 6 chicken fingers, Texas toast, coleslaw, fries, and a drink. Just as I remember it, tender and juicy.  As some may have said before, be careful on the first bite, these things are HOT, not spicy but temperature.  I think they cook the chicken to order.  I really like the sauce, it's peppery with the right amount of tangy-ness.  I think that's the whole reason I go!  If you haven't tried the sauce you should, because I didn't at first and didn't like the chicken, but the combo with together it tastes amazing!  The fries are standard, tastes like the Ore-ida brand.  If you like sweet tea, the sweet tea is good, especially with during the hot Vegas weather.  I like that they service the drink with crushed ice, I like it better than the cubes.  Personally, I don't like the toast, I feel it needs something else.  Maybe next time, I'll spend the sauce on it to see how it tastes, maybe that's what it needs.  Enough of this fatass talk...

The service is good, everyone there is so nice.  You get greeted when you enter and when you leave.  I can't wait for my next Vegas trip, because Vegas locations are the closest locations to CA!",positive
ch185,9/3/2012,revch329,5,"Normally when I think of chicken fingers, I think of over-battered insipid dried pieces of chicken just short of reaching jerky status.  And this is for the chicken fingers that I considered pretty decent.

Raising Cane's chicken fingers completely shattered all my preconceived notions of what great chicken fingers were.  So moist and hot, they should come with a disclaimer, as the hot steam escaping from your first bite will surely burn you.  I doubt that one can even find chicken fingers so good in a sit-down restaurant setting.  The dipping sauce that it comes with is ok, akin to a peppery mayonnaise, but left me wishing that I had one of those little travel size Tabasco sauces.  Next time I will get it to-go or bring my own sauce.

All of this for a price that even a college student would consider a bargain.",positive
ch185,8/21/2012,revch330,5,Raising Cane's Chicken Fingers and Texas toast are De.Li.Ci.Ous...especially after a night of partying it up on the Strip.

At first I was expecting something along the lines of KFC. But this was WAY better. Their special sauce, which seems like mayo + ketchup + pepper, doesnt taste like much on its own, but with the chicken, omg Im drooling just thinking about it. The chicken is nicely breaded without being too thick or greasy, the krinkle cut fries arent greasy either and have a nice crunch, the toast is thick and fluffy and nicely flavored without being greasy either. You might be able to tell Im surprised by the lack of grease. 

Other than the food, the place was a little messy, but it was pretty busy and they seemed short staffed. But totally willing to overlook that with their awesome food! Cant wait to go back the next time Im in Vegas!",positive

ch185,8/10/2012,revch334,5,"What's not to like about this place? 

The menu is super simple; you order pretty much based on how many chicken strips you want. Their ""Box"" combo includes 4 chicken fingers, crinkle fries, a thick slice of Texas toast (buttery, garlicky and grilled), coleslaw and a cup of their lovely sauce, plus a drink. 

I love the following: the crinkle fries, since no one has them anymore; the chicken, which is crispy without being bready, moist without being soggy; the coleslaw tastes nothing like the slop at other chicken places; their sauce is to.die.for.; and they use crushed ice in their drinks, which I love, but I'm not sure why.

Tips: you can purchase extra sauce, but it you sauce properly, one cup should do it. If you bring your dog through the drive thru, they'll sometimes give you a dog biscuit. Any business that has a soft spot for my pup is a good business!",positive
ch185,8/7/2012,revch335,3,"Where's the ranch?!
Came here before work for a quick bite. I ordered the chicken sandwich and three extra fingers on the side plus a medium drink. The total was 10.01, I gave the cashier a 10.00 dollar bill that I had on my hand ready thinking that it would be enough. She stood there waiting for me to come up with the missing penny, I gave her another 10.00 dollar bill and she gave me my 9.99 change back, I took the four pennies and placed them on the side so the next person that needed a penny could use them.
 When I got my chicken I realized there was no dipping sauce so I went back to the counter and asked an employee for some ranch for my chicken, the guy looked at me like I had asked for something no one has ever asked for and said "" we don't have that.""  can I get some BBQ then? "" we don't have that either. ""  you mean. You're out of everything? "" No. we only carry our special sauce "" ( ok, now that you made me feel stupid for asking for something weird like ranch dressing in a chicken finger place ), can I have some of your special sauce, please? "" sure, that'll be 31 cents""  by now I'm wishing I would've stopped at a 7/11 and got a freaking hot dog, but luckily I had change thanks to employee number one. I handed him 35 Cents that he then handed to employee # 1 (cashier), she was busy taking someone else order so she sat the money on the side and took the four cents that I had previously left and gave them to me as change.

So why do I find myself here at least once a week? There's something that keeps drawing me back to Cane's. Maybe it's the sauce. Maybe it's the super-moist chicken. It's probably not the always-friendly and borderline overly-enthusiastic employees, but they're certainly a nice bonus.

Once I dip the chicken (and the fries, and the toast) into the Cane's sauce, any complaints of sogginess go out the window and all I want is more sauce. The fresh-squeezed lemonade and reasonable prices ($6.29 for three fingers, fries, toast, and a drink) are also appreciated.

At least everything on the menu is good even the drinks! I love their sweet tea, and also their fresh squeezed lemonade, made fresh from real lemons everyday, (which by the way is not refillable and cost a few quarters more). Their secret ranch/ketchup/pepper dipping sauce is pretty bomb too, and if you want extra it's .50c more too, but hey am not complaining coz I LOVE their food!

However after trying their signature Caniac meal I knew why they only had one thing on the menu, because you wouldn't want to order anything else anyway! The Caniac comes with 6 chicken fingers, french fries, grilled texas toast bread, and Cane's special sauce. The Cane's sauce is hands down the best dipping sauce I have ever had and the Caniac is more than enough to fill me up and I can eat!

Let me just say that I've not burped up any funky tastes after eating here, or burped peroid for that matter. I was very impressed by the fact that the outside was crunchy and the inside was juicy and moist and it was cooked perfectly! The sauce is ok however I don't like mayo based sauces and I like my fingers plain with bbq sauce or louisiana hot sauce. The fries were good but I will say that I have had better fries at other places. The texas toast was a great compliment to the fingers, grilled but soft and not slathed in oil or butter. I didn't eat the cole slaw because well I just don't like cole slaw. LOL.

Who said tenders/fingers are for kids?!

The best part was the sauce.  Most of their meals comes with one or two, but I ordered an extra for 30 cents or something.  I guess the other best part was the freshly brewed sweetened tea.  Brings me back to when I used to live in the South and where sweetened tea is their specialty.",positive

In all honesty, Raising Cane's does serve up some of the best tasting chicken strips I've ever had. And definitely the best I've ever had from a fast food joint. Every strip is fresh and prepared after they're ordered. They're super crispy on the outside and juicy in the middle but the best thing is there is zero grease on these strips. The fries were also nice and crispy on the outside and fluffy in the middle. The toast, slaw and sauce were all amazing too. Oh, and their sweet tea is perfect. Not overly sweet. Perfect. 

Prices are dirt cheap and service is fast and friendly.

The combination of chicken, slaw, fries, and toast together satisfies me in all ways; the texas toast is by far the best toast I have ever had, really!

The chicken fingers were pretty good for a fast food chain but what I really enjoyed was the Texas Toast!  It was soft yet sweet.  Delicious.  I also liked their sauce - it tasted like a blend of ketchup, mayonnaise, soy sauce, pepper and sugar.  It wasn't quite as sweet as I had expected (it has a color similar to Thousand Island but it's definitely different) but it went well with the chicken.

- sauce: great sauce, although not the orgasmic experience a few mention, but indeed have to have it with the chicken fingers
- fries: equivalent to Ore-Ida; can't beat the In-n-Out fresh fries: you can tell the difference
- texas toast: mine was a less crunch like they took it out 10 seconds sooner than it should

Kids did eat everything on the kids meal so give Canes credit for that.",negative

ch185,8/14/2011,revch377,4,"I'm really jealous that we don't have this in Southern California! I really enjoyed their Chicken Fingers! Their Chicken is so moist and juicy in every bite. They're definitely bland without their signature secret Cane's sauce, it's a simple recipe and it was fun breaking down the ingredients but it would be wrong for me to tell you what was in it, even their employees are sworn to secrecy. It was so good, I almost forgot that I was eating fast food! The fries were okay because they weren't fresh but frozen bag and my least favorite item included. The cole slaw was very good, dressed well and perhaps made fresh daily. The texas toast was seasoned perfectly, toasted nicely and soft outside. I didn't get to try their lemonade but their sweet tea is good but go easy on the ice. Their ice melts so fast and then becomes less sweet.

I really enjoyed the look of the restaurant! Elvis, The Rat Pack, Led Zeppelin, Muhammad Ali and other classic american icons grace the walls. I couldn't get enough of the decor nor the food! I've heard so much about this company but was skeptical about the fact that they're a fast food joint and I was proven wrong.",positive
ch185,8/7/2011,revch378,4,"Texas Toast and Cane's Sauce. Really, that's all you need when you come to Cane's. Something about the buttery, crispy deliciousness of the Texas Toast with the creaminess to the ambiguous Cane's Sauce (similar to a Thousand Island dressing with far more pepper) - it's euphoria in your mouth.

As for the chicken fingers, they are definitely better than what they used to be. When Cane's first came to Vegas, the fingers were dry and the downfall of the place. However, they have most certainly improved - moist and perfectly fried. The fries are decent, just sub-par crinkle fries that I tend to not even order. The slaw is good, but nothing extraordinary. 
Then there's the tea - a bit too sweet for my liking, but always consistently good. 

But I'm telling you, the toast and the sauce. All you need really. If anything, get the chicken on the side.",positive

ch185,7/18/2011,revch380,5,"When I first heard about this place, I was reluctant to try because chicken fingers are one of my favorite foods. However, I finally gave in and decided to check it out, and let me say, I have been eating here at least twice a week since. The chicken fingers and fries are great, but what really makes the experience amazing is the Cane's sauce. It is so good I almost want to dip everything I eat in it for the rest of my life. The sweet tea is consistently amazing, something I appreciate because places like Lucille's and Memphis BBQ struggle to keep their sweet tea consistent.

This place is definitely worth giving a try, and if you're a sauce person, ordering an extra side of Cane's sauce will probably be necessary.",positive
ch185,7/16/2011,revch381,5,The sandwhich combo is amazing and a great deal compared to other fast food chicken sandwhiches.  You get more chicken than anywhere else and you can't beat the Cane's sauce.  Who cares if the combo is about 1000-1200 calories? :-P,positive

Sweet tea is a must for my wife but I have also been told the lemonade is outstanding.  Great spot for a fast food meal sure to please your taste buds every time",positive
ch185,6/27/2011,revch384,5,"First off, I have had better chicken fingers elsewhere. I've had better fries, sweet tea, and everything else this place serves. 

However.

Cane's puts it all together and pairs it with this SAUCE that I'm sure is just Thousand Island with some black pepper but It makes everything taste better. But then again that is the major flaw of Canes as well in that It needs this sauce to really cross the threshold of beyond ""average"" because without the sauce, the chicken fingers are quite bland and have very little flavor (tasting somewhat like Church's Chicken) despite being juicy and fresh-cooked to order.

The Texas Toast is what does it for me though. I love that bread and it's perfectly grilled every time! The Fries are average fries, there to look pretty and munch on after you are done with the toast and chicken.

The price is right though and the service is fast. Can't complain too much about this place, and the ambiance of the actual restaurant is good for just sitting and conversations.

So I thought I would give it a whirl. 

My monkeys, mom and myself all rolled in and each ordered a combo (I think I got the box lunch and my mom got the smallest one). Oh Dear Lord! The strips were soft, the fries were crinkle cut and perfectly crispy (just like I like them), the cole slaw wasn't too soupy, the Texas toast melted in my mouth and THE SAUCE. Their sauce should be a 5th food group. I put it on everything (strips, toast, fries, fingers). 

Their sweet tea and lemonade are quite tasty as well and very refreshing. Will be a loyal patron of Raising Canes because of their genuinely friendly service, great food and nice place for kids.",positive

-There was a line but it moved quick.
-Orders came out speedy quick as well.
-Toast-- Yum for bread lovers. The slight sweetness of it really offsets everything else.
-Chicken-- Pretty damn good for chicken fingers! Lightly battered, crispy, and moist. Made the fries an ""ehh"" for me. And I love me some fries. Oh and I almost forgot about the coleslaw. Cuz it really didn't need to be there for me.

I felt like I was in chicken paradise for a moment till my finance 'accidentally' took a bite at the last piece of the chicken finger. Staring at his satisfying grin, I had to question his explanation.
Anyway this was a great eating experience despite the complain coming from my tummy after all the fries glided in my stomach.",positive
ch185,2/17/2011,revch400,4,"Yummm! That about sums up my experience at Raising Cane's. Not much more to really say other then this place has really good fried chicken. It's a shame that none have opened up in California yet, but with chicken this good, it's definitely just a matter of time. 

However, before I rave about Raising Cane's, I feel that I need to respond to a negative review about the place from a certain Elite '11 member from Henderson, Nevada that yelped how Raising Cane's is ""really expensive"" for chicken fingers and that the 5 star reviews awarded by reviewers were mostly from ""Californians who are deprived of food that doesn't taste like absolutely nothing"". Come again? Those darned double negatives can be so baffling.

In regards to the price, Raising Cane's flagship combo is the ""Box Combo"", which consists of four generously proportioned chicken fingers, French fries, a slice of toast, a side of coleslaw, a side of sauce, and a drink that costs $6.79. Hardly a wallet buster! 

Moreover, compared to KFC' similar combo meal, the Variety Big Box Meal, which consists of a drumstick, a chicken strip, popcorn chicken, two small sides, a biscuit, and a drink that costs $5.99, the price difference of $0.80 seems hardly expensive, let alone ""really expensive"". And seriously, this member has probably never been to Chick fil-A where a 4-piece chicken strip meal costs $6.49. 

And the audacity to imply that Californians do not know what food tastes like and that California is the land of no seasoning is a gross misstatement. Seriously, apart from the Las Vegas area, the state of Nevada is nothing but a large sandbox with its total population (2.7 million) being less than that of the city of Los Angeles (3.8 million). Additionally, many of the restaurants along the Las Vegas Strip are spin-offs or branches of restaurants that were started by renowned chefs in California. Therefore, I really think the Elite '11 status of this member should be revoked. 

Anyways, back to Raising Cane's. The chicken is au natural and is made from premium chicken that isn't frozen. For a fast-food restaurant this is a rarity. It's one thing to say your chicken is 100% chicken, but to also proclaim that your chicken is never frozen is a testament to the freshness and quality of the food being served. As for the breading, the spices infused with the seasoning yelped of Southern flavoring. Trust me, I've been to the South (Alabama, Texas, the Carolinas), and for a fast-food restaurant, this is as close to authentic as you will get for $6.79. I literally enjoyed every bite. In fact as I ate, I ended up taking a huge ass bite of my lower lip. Yet despite my bleeding and swollen lip, I continued to inhale my chicken fingers like a whale pausing only to catch my breath and to dip my chicken into Cane's special ketchup/mayo/pepper/spice sauce. 

As for the coleslaw, fries, and Texas toast, they were okay, but I honestly didn't give a shit because the chicken was so ""finger-lipping"" good!

In regards to the drinks, Raising Cane's has your standard fountain drinks. But the real highlight is their sweet tea, which is really sweeeeeeeeeeeeet. While I'm sure it contains buckets of sugar (hence its sweetness), what kind of hypocrite would I be if I were counting calories at a fried-food restaurant? 

So, if you too would like to enjoy being a glutton for a day, hop into Raising Cane's to indulge in really good fried chicken... and definitely be sure to wash down all that yummilicious fried goodness with Raising Cane's sweet tea.",positive

It was just eerie that, after I double checked every booth, I was the youngest person there.  People, I am not young.

As usual, service was very good.  The food was ok, not great.  Clearly it is relying on the tried and true vs exciting.  The restaurant is still attractive, but the atmosphere isn't the same when you overhear those around you complain multiple times to the server how salty the food is and how cold it is in there (as a Phoenix native who finds 85 degrees my perfect temp, I am confident in saying it was definitely not cold in there).

We skipped on the appetizers so we could order one of their amazing sounding desserts and we weren't disappointed. Went with the White Chocolate Banana Cream Pie - ""A Graham Cracker and Chocolate Chunk Crust, Fresh Bananas and Vanilla Pastry Cream. With Caramel, Whipped Cream and Shaved White Chocolate"" - make this happen if you go...seriously.

Overall: A
If you want happy hour deals - sit at the bar, otherwise the dining area has great ambiance, and the food won't disappoint!",positive
ch194,8/18/2014,revch433,4,"Good service.  Had the Kale and Spinach salad.  Even though it was lightly dressed, it was a little salty for my taste.  But the good service and nice decor makes me want to go back.",positive
ch194,8/17/2014,revch434,3,"First time here with my date.. The food was great an tasty though a bit on the pricey side. Very nice place and again the food was good. 

The service on the other hand was very weak at best. She never said her name, only asked to fill our drinks one time, and really was not very communicative. Hopefully she is just having a bad day

I would still come back because the food is good.",negative
ch194,8/11/2014,revch435,5,This place has wonderful food! We had never heard of this place before but drove up on it looking for a place for dinner. We lucked out on a wonderful place. Great quiet atmosphere and very good food. The desserts are to die for. This place won't disappoint,positive
ch194,8/10/2014,revch436,5,"Came here with my god-daughter to celebrate her 18th birthday.  We had a great time and it was perfect.  I ordered the New York Strip and their mash potatoes.  Cooked to perfection....  Roast Prime Rib with asparagus.  She inhaled the whole prime rib and all the veggies.  WOW, I think she loved it?  LOL!  We had White Chocolate Brownie for dessert:  A Warm Blonde Brownie, Freshly Baked with Callebaut Chocolate and Topped with French Vanilla Ice Cream, Warm Chocolate Sauce and Whipped Cream.  It was so good!  The service was outstanding.",positive
ch194,8/8/2014,revch437,4,I took my wife there for my anniversary. The service was very good. I had the WCG salad. Best of all was the desert we had the white chocolate brownie. It was great they took reservations.,positive
ch194,8/7/2014,revch438,4,"I have been here many times and usually order the WCG salad and soup, as I did tonight. I'm not a fan of onions and tonight I accidentally forgot to order my salad without onions. The server, Michele was very pleasant and noticed me picking the onions out. She was very quick to offer to have a fresh one made without the onions. I would not have asked since it was my mistake. She didn't hesitate. The salad was wonderful as always. The dressing is the perfect compliment too. I love the chicken enchilada soup. My mother loves the tomato soup. The WCG brownie dessert is wonderful and my husband loves the bread pudding. We didn't order dessert tonight, but it was really hard not to. We are not dessert eaters when dining out so When we do order dessert it's usually here and It's always difficult for us to make a choice between the two. 

The service tonight was on point and well managed. We noticed this restaurant clearly trains their staff to help each other. Our drinks were always full and our completed dishes promptly removed.  We had a great date night experience. We will definitely be back!!

The only reason I didn't give a full 5 star rating is the noise level in this restaurant, as in most places anymore, is kind of high.",positive
ch194,8/5/2014,revch439,5,"Let me just start by saying OMG!!! My hubby and I were in the neighborhood and came here for lunch. walking up to the place you see a huge outdoor covered patio with big cushy chairs and huge fireplace. Great place to chill while waiting in the cooler AZ months (they also have a huge dining patio on the back of the building with an even bigger fireplace). Upon walking in the front door, there are lit rock walls with dark wood through out. To your right is the bar with a floor to ceiling liquor wall that is lit from behind making the whole wall glow with booze!! It's very eye catching. The seats in the bar area are quite unique too, all half booths which face the wall o' booze and a few large flat screen tv's, it's also teared like stadium seating.
We sat in the main dining room just to the left of the bar. It was a very upscale, yet chill/cozy atmosphere.  throughout the main dining area are mostly all cozy booths and half booths. the lighting is dim but not so dim that you can't see your hand in front of your face or so dim you can't read the menu.
The wait staff is very friendly, accommodating, and efficient. The prices, are actually quite decent. I didn't see anything on the lunch or dinner menu that was a break the bank kind of price. Since we were there for lunch, we just had a sandwich and salad. My hubby got the French Dip. I know that sounds average and boring, but it was the best looking and best tasting french dip i think I've ever had and my hubby said the same thing! It was freshly sliced roast beef, like prime rib sliced thin on a french baguette. The meat was buttery soft and melted in your mouth. I just had a salad, their Southern chicken salad. it was HUGE! It's a salad, not much to say with that other than it was also very good. The most awesome part of our dinning experience was dessert!! this is a place you go to where you NEED to save room for their desserts! We split the White Chocolate Brownie. This thing was a meal in itself! the brownie had to be at least 3 or 4 inches square then topped with vanilla ice cream and white chocolate shavings. When the brought it out it had to have stood about a foot tall! We devoured it! how we had room for that is anybodies guess. It's very rich and decadent and you can bes' believe I was at the gym for a loooong time to work that off my waist! So well worth every single calorie!! I'd say this is a great date night spot! Can't wait to get back up there to enjoy their dinner menu and another over-the-top dessert!!!",positive
ch194,8/4/2014,revch440,5,Went here for the first time this weekend on Saturday night with some friends. The place was packed. Great ambience and excellent and prompt service. I had fried artichokes for an appetizer and the Filet Mignon Cobb Salad. They were both excellent choices but the dessert blew me away! I'm from the South and have tried lots of bread puddings but the White Chocholate Bread Pudding was by far the best I've tried! Will definitely be going back soon!,positive
ch194,8/3/2014,revch441,5,"Went there for my baby's birthday for the first time and it was amazing! We had the double dip app(8.99) which was so tasty! The chips were thin and not oily at all, the guacamole was awesome and the cheese was yummy even if it was a bit spicy! My baby ordered the balsamic ribeye( 27.89) with broccoli as her side. The ribeye, huge tomatoes and the mashed potatoes were awesome! The broccoli on the other hand was soooo salty!! It was more like a side of salt with some broccoli. I ordered the kale salad ( 13.99) and it was huge but tasted so good! It wasn't too much dressing and the chicken that was mixed in the salad was delicious! We will have to go back to try desserts because we couldn't eat anymore after all this yummy food!",positive
ch194,8/1/2014,revch442,5,A client of mine gave me a $100 gift card and I've gone in for lunch twice in the last month.  I've had the French dip and the Southwest Chicken salad....yum on both!!,positive
ch194,7/31/2014,revch443,5,"Our Server Sarah (Short hair) was very pleasant and attentive.  My girlfriend and I dined at lunch on a Thursday in the heat of late July and they were moderately busy.  It seemed like a lot of business lunch and early retirees.  All the servers helped to fill drinks which I thought was great because most restaurants have servers who are snippy/greedy about their tips and only care to serve their own tables/needs.  The teamwork here really helped to elevate the service.

Great decor, not too dark but dark enough to create the right ambiance for this upscale American food.  Healthy comfort food.  The appetizer special was the double dip which came with freshly fried tortilla chips and jalapeno queso dip/salsa/guacamole.  Great portion.  Good dips! 

For Entree it was the Filet mignon Cobb Salad for her, and the Spinach Kale salad for me.  House made dressings really make a salad and theirs were on point.  The filet cobb had a bite from the intense bleu cheese they put on the plate but combined with the steak and their red wine vinaigrette with marinated mushrooms, it was so good!

The tanginess from the asian dressing on the kale salad worked well with their strawberries and sesame seeds.  I believe the kale was either quickly blanched or massaged into submission to lend it's mellow and comforting texture.  This is crucial for a kale salad otherwise you'll be looking like a dinosaur trying to conquer those big leaves.

Great place and my girl and I will definitely remember this place and be sure to be back!",positive
ch194,7/30/2014,revch444,4,"Enjoyed the BBQ trio, and a very good selection of draft beers. I'd recommend it, and will be back next time I'm in Scottsdale.",positive
ch194,7/30/2014,revch445,5,"A very lovely atmosphere. Our waiter was Anthony and he did an excellent job, especially with my gluten free allergy. If you go there, get the ribs. They literally fall off the bone!  My only disappointment with this restaurant is the seats, I hate having to look way up to my waiter. That was annoying. Otherwise, reasonably priced for the quality you get. They even have a gluten free dessert to die for!",positive
ch194,7/28/2014,revch446,4,Food was excellent. French dip sandwich was excellent and had no fat on it. The banana cream pie was excellent too. Service was excellent and all servers seem to help out. A little bit pricey but overall was an excellent place to eat.,positive
ch194,7/28/2014,revch447,2,"My boyfriend and I received a gift card from a friend so we decided to dine last night. 

The server was very sweet but lacked professionalism and experience. 

I ordered the Dragonberry Lemonade and the server had to come back and tell me they were out of the Dragonberry rum. I picked another drink - but... I have to say, I work for 8 restaurants in food and beverage at a resort and in no way do I think it's acceptable to run out of an ingredient for a cocktail featured on the menu. 

We ordered our entrees, my boyfriend the filet and myself the prime rib. The server tried to suggest adding mushrooms to his filet but couldn't tell us what kind of mushrooms they were and instead settled for drawing us a picture of what the mushroom looked like. 10 minutes after we ordered the server came back and told me they were out of the prime rib. It DOES say ""limited availability"" on the menu and I understand this is an easy item to run out of but I think a server should know this prior to taking an order at the table. I opted to have the balsamic ribeye instead. 

When our food arrived everything was cooked perfectly but we both found everything to be over seasoned. The balsamic ribeye was delicious but the flavor was too intense for an entire steak. I could only eat a couple bites because it was so rich. 

For dessert we had the brownie which the server said was the best which we thought was just mediocre. 

This isn't a restaurant we would recommend or come back to. It was just ""eh"".",negative
ch194,7/24/2014,revch448,5,"This place was fantastic and the service was fabulous! I had the tomato gin soup, which is one of their house specialty. I almost locked my bowl clean. Our group had the mahi mahi, the soy-citrus salmon, the perfectly grilled salmon, and he balsamic ribeye. Everything was perfectly cooked and absolutely delicious! The white chocolate brownie was mouth wetting and a great finish to the meal. Our waiter was very attentive and helped us with our decisions and what to order. His recommendations on food and beverages was perfect!",positive
ch194,7/19/2014,revch449,5,"Best happy hour and great food!! Love the chicken tenders, burger sliders, ribs and southern fried chicken salad!!",positive
ch194,7/12/2014,revch450,5,"Nice atmosphere and great service.   I had the Parm crusted filet and it came out slightly over cooked.  The server agreed and immediately grabbed the plate to have them refire a new steak and let me know it would take a while and offered soup or salad while I waited.  The second steak was melt in your mouth amazing.   When something happens, taking care of it promptly and effectively is what service is about.  I would return to WCG and recommend it to others.

The server was also very helpful with recommendations for wine pairings as well.   Excellent dinner!",positive
ch194,7/9/2014,revch451,4,"Nice place. I went there for lunch with my coworkers, had tuna grill burger it was awesome. 
Service: I order for Tuna but instead got the veggie burger, waiter and manager both came over to apologize and didn't charge me for burger. Which shows me how much they care about their customers.

I would recommend this place to anyone.",positive
ch194,7/9/2014,revch452,4,"Absolutely love this place! The bartenders are great! They are very knowledgeable. They have a great happy hour with both food and drink. Classy atmosphere. I do have two complaints. The lighting in the bar and the A/C. Please turn down the lights a little. I feel like I'm being interrogated. Also, cool the bar to a comfortable temperature.",positive
ch194,7/7/2014,revch453,3,"It's hit or miss here.   The Tomato Gin soup is ""off the chain""....but the gravy on the rotisserie chicken crepe will have you running to find the nearest outhouse.  The desserts are blah.    You would think being named the ""White chocolate Grill"" you would have some awesome desserts.  No, they are simply ""okay"".  Nothing to write home to mom about.   On the other hand, the service is awesome  and there is no pretentious behavior from waitstaff.... in spite of the location.",negative
ch194,7/5/2014,revch454,5,We love White Chocolate Grill. The desserts are listed on the top of the menu (and for a reason). We will come here literally just for the bread pudding ! Top notch service ... The chocolate martini is a great after dinner drink. Whiskey selection is amazing. I would recommend it to anyone.,positive
ch194,6/30/2014,revch455,5,"This is one of my favorite restaurants. I love the shrimp cocktail for the appetizer and filet mignon steak salad as an entree .  I've been here maybe 6 or 7 times and I still love coming back.  The ambiance is great, service is great, food is good, and the deserts are to die for. Prices are $$ to $$$ but I  don't mind paying for good food and good service.  They get kind of busy in the regular eating times, i try to go a little later to avoid the rush.  Highly recommended!  You won't be disappointed.",positive
ch194,6/18/2014,revch456,4,"I've always been a happy camper leaving this place. 
They have a very cool looking bar with their bottles lit up and colorful. I like sitting at the tables around it even though the lighting is bad. It's like the flashlight under your face effect. Not cute!
I prefer the Sesame Crusted Ahi Tuna for the appetizer. The tuna comes out on a slaw that tastes amazing with a soy dressing and a side of wasabi you can mix in. This isn't a fish restaurant but I get on a fish-kick and LOVE their Blacked Fish Sandwich. It's always cooked perfectly and really like the sauce. The steamed broccoli are big pieces and always fresh. I wouldn't recommend the honey roasted carrots - they are soaked in whatever they are calling honey roasted and just tastes like carrots coated in sugar. Yuck. 
I like dessert and like chocolate but don't like anything from here. Maybe too much white chocolate for me.",positive
ch194,6/14/2014,revch457,5,"Went here with my boyfriend for our anniversary. Top notch. We both got coffee Jameson's to start out. Both of our drinks were very strong and that is NEVER a problem. I also got a vodka water and it was very strong. Drinks here are great!

As for food.. I got the Cajun chicken sandwich with a side of fries. The sandwich was pretty amazing! The fries are shoestring style and tasted amazing. My boyfriend got the prime rib and said it was absolutely perfect.

We got the white chocolate brownie for dessert.. Definitely one of the best desserts I've ever had! And I'm a sweet food enthusiast ;)

Our waitress was Tara and she was great! Service was a bit on the slow side, but it was Saturday so rah is to be expected. 

Overall superb experience and we will definitely be back!",positive
ch194,6/12/2014,revch458,1,"I would give zero stars if I could.  My water remained empty the entire meal.  We were there to celebrate my wife's birthday and dessert is not free on birthdays.  Not a big deal, but Denny's has more class than this joint.  They have a ""vegan"" burger.....served on an egg bun.  Sharp thinking, genius chef!  Their $14 kale and spinach salad has only one vegan dressing- oil and vinegar.  Gross!  The people I was with said their food wasn't that great, either.  My wife had a field greens salad and currently can't drink enough water because something was spicy and she has an awful taste in her mouth.  Their $8 ""birthday"" bread pudding (thanks for the free candle, cheapskates) ""sucked"" according to everyone who tried it.  Awful, awful, awful.  Never again.  I hope this place is boarded up and replaced with ANYTHING- even a Chili's, Applebees, or Sizzler would be higher end than this noisy dump.",negative

It was about 9:00pm and so we had the restaurant to ourselves. We ordered the banana cream pie, bread pudding, rasberry cheesecake and the chocolate cake.  All were amazingly good!  I especially liked the bread pudding.  Make sure you share, their portions are for 2 people.  Needless to say, we took the leftovers home.",positive
ch194,5/31/2014,revch461,4,"I really enjoyed this place, we sat outside which was kind of enclosed and misted so it was pleasant to eat there.
Our waiter was really nice and got us some drinks started which were pretty strong, so no complaints there. We had the bacon, blue cheese salad and added steak and it was so good. we also shared the blackened fish sandwich which was also amazing. I had the Israeli couscous as a side and it made the meal. The portions are large but we managed to squeeze in a dessert, who wouldn't in a place called the white chocolate grill?!
We had the white chocolate brownie, made for two it was huge and after dinner we didn't finish it but definitely worth a taste. I would recommend it to anyone in the area looking for a casual dinner. The bar area was nice too with tables all facing the tvs if thats your thing.",positive
ch194,5/30/2014,revch462,2,"When we go out to eat this is often our go-to place because it's easy and the menu has something for everyone, but the food quality is hit or miss. Unfortunately after my last experience I doubt we will return. I took some family on Saturday (day before Mother's Day) we arrived at 11:30am and the restaurant was very quite. They sat us at a booth that had a horrible stench of dirty mildew. We moved tables, but they were all the same. For just opening for the day this was just disgusting. We had their chips and guacamole to start and the chips were old and stale and for my entree I had their ""famous chicken salad"" and I can tell you it was far from famous. The chicken had an old foul smell and taste (the kind that makes you worry how sick you will be the next day). Horrible experience",negative

Sean was our server, and he went above and beyond to make sure that we had a great experience. I had the salmon, my husband had the steak, and both were great! I should have gone with Sean's suggestion for the side of carrots, but chose my own, the mashed potatoes. They were okay, not amazing, but I guess not everything can be! 

We will be back, and hopefully get Sean as our server again. He made the dinner a very good and memorable one!",positive

The food was tasty. We tried the Famous Chicken salad and the baby back ribs. Both were delicious and we loved them. 

My only complaint is with the service. Our server seemed a little inattentive and preoccupied. Who doesn't bring extra napkins with an order of baby back ribs?! I don't really believe in docking stars for 1-time service, but just a tip to ask for this napkins while you order! ;)",positive

The food was quite good and reasonably priced.  I would have rated the restaurant as 4 star.  So far, so good.  My problem is that the waiter (Westmorland?) could have done much better.  He took our orders and the food was served in a timely manner.  As is often the case, people from the kitchen brought out and served the meals.  Our waiter never came around until the meals were almost finished to see if everything was OK.  It was not.  Had he come around, I would have asked for Tabasco sauce, as well as bread.  By the time he asked, there was no need for the Tabasco sauce.  In terms of the bread, he said that it is brought only if asked for.  If that was the case, I think he should have asked if we wanted bread.  If it is the management's policy of not delivering bread unless asked for, the menu should have stated so.  Would we come back?  Sure.  Would we ask for Westmorland?  No.  If we were seated put at his station, we would not ask to be reseated.

For the price I was definitely expecting way better food but this seemed nothing to write home about. The best part was the appetizer, grilled artichoke with parmesan cheese with lemon aioli. That definitely would get 5 stars on its own. However, the runner who brought out our food took my artichoke and it was only half eaten! I asked them to bring me another one to replace it since that's like throwing half your meal away. Not sure if we'll be back but we shall see.",negative

ch194,3/9/2014,revch487,5,"This place is the place to go in northern Scottsdale, for a reasonably priced and delicious meal! Always packed.

They have really unusual dishes, that make it hard to pick what to order!
I had the  Rotisserie Chicken Crêpes filled with rotisserie chicken, spinach and a mushroom cream sauce. Topped with Madeira sauce and parmesan cheese.
Delicious!!

Then my hubby and I finishes with the White Chocolate Brownie a la Mode.
WOW!  Fantastic! We even came back another night on our trip, for dessert, and had the White Chocolate Brownie, again!!

I highly recommend the White Chocolate Grill!",positive
ch194,3/6/2014,revch488,4,"I've been coming here since they first opened.  Consistent quality of service and great food make me a frequent diner here.  Plenty of seating area makes easy to get seated right away during lunch time.  Perfect for business lunch, with variety of menu, we all can find something we like to eat.

My favorite is Tomato Gin Soup, followed by Ahi Tuna Salad.  I like the hamburger, grilled salmon, crab cake... I don't think I ever had anything I didn't like.

Don't forget the desert too. Can't pick my favorites. All good.  Desert potion is large enough to share with others. I wish they have smaller portion desert, then I will be ordering desert all the time.",positive
ch194,2/23/2014,revch489,5,"WCG came highly recommended from a friend who used to be a manager there. We made a rez for 8pm Saturday night and I'm glad we did...it was packed and a fair number of ppl were hanging outside. We had an absolutely fantastic meal from start to finish; the drinks were stiff; the kale salad was enough for three to share as a starter; the ribs and chicken were very tasty; our guests had the quinoa burger and soy glazed salmon, both received two thumbs up; and finally, the cheesecake and chocolate soufflé were the perfect amount of decadence. Special thanks to Ryan and Elizabeth for their excellent service. Overall, a great dinner with family on a Saturday night",positive

This place was outstanding !",positive
ch194,2/9/2014,revch492,4,"Food was great. The crab cakes are the BEST I've tasted. Only the bottom of a huge pile of crab meat was breaded to keep the shape. The crab was sooooo tasty and not ruined with heavy sauces. This is our 4th time there in 2 months and have been consistently impressed by everyone from greeter on the way in to greeter saying good night as we leave. The only reason for 4 stars is the noise level is very high. Guess it's a eat, pay, get out philosophy although we were never rushed.",positive
ch194,2/1/2014,revch493,5,"The is a great restaurant with an off-putting name. The food is consistently delicious. I love their salmon dishes, their salads, and the service. The WCG salad with bacon and blue cheese is a guilty pleasure. My husband loves the crab cakes, which are much more crab than cake. The spaghetti squash side is delicious. Always ask about the specials. I had a divine beet salad special. My husband always orders the grilled artichoke appetizer when in season. My friend Jazz loves the chicken enchiladas; the tortilla soup is good as well. This is our go-to place when visitors come in from out of town. A reservation is a must if you're going at a peak time. Forget the goofy name and go! We're glad we did.",positive
ch194,1/28/2014,revch494,5,My colleague suggested to check this place out for our client lunch. Wow the menu looks amazing. I went with the suggested salad which was filet mignon and I was not disappointed. Yummy!!! We also shared the grilled artichoke was super good too. Great service who kept refilling my Arnold Palmer's. I definitely will be back next time I am in town! I am a fan!!,positive
ch194,1/22/2014,revch495,4,"It took me almost a year to come back after a poor dining experience.  However, I tried it again and really enjoyed myself.  The service was very good, the salmon was prepared to perfection.  The other meals at the table: the jambalya, the French dip were equally prepared well.  All in all, a very nice meal.  Would consider returning if I was in the area.",positive
ch194,1/21/2014,revch496,5,"I have eaten at this amazing restaurant many times. I take all my out of town guests here and they love it as much as I do. We found this place by accident, but it was an awesome discovery. Don't let the name fool you. They are apparently known for their desserts, I have only gotten the banana cream pie. It is so good, I cant resist but get it every time. Between myself, my husband and our guests no one has had a bad meal. My favorite restaurant in north Scottsdale! I promise you wont be disappointed.",positive

Decor is beautiful.  Great for lunch or dinner.  The one at Park Meadows is located next to an American Girl Doll store that doesn't have a cafe inside.  They honor the girls bringing their dolls to lunch.  Cute.

Skinny on the food:

I am one for mixing things up when I go to a restaurant BUT this place is the exception.  Filet Mignon Cobb Salad every time.  It's big enough to split with another person too.",positive
ch194,1/8/2014,revch499,5,"My wonderful in-laws took me here for a late birthday present. (My birthday was several months ago) I had the fillet topped with blue cheese and it was outstanding! 

I've been to this place three times and every time it was nothing but extraordinary. 

It is a little pricey but if you have a few extra bucks and are hungry (I always am!) I highly reccomend that you stop by here if you're in the Scottsdale area.",positive
ch194,1/7/2014,revch500,2,"So the food was okay nothing was great. Here were my biggest problems, 1st the plates are to big, meaning I ordered the filet and broccoli. The steak is small being a filet and the mashed potato that was supposed to come with it was smaller than the steak. The plate was big and the portion was not, so visually it was disappointing. Second issue was the dessert, we ordered two the first was the brownie and that was great the second was the white chocolate raspberry cheesecake. Here it is, that cheesecake is not a raspberry cheesecake. It is a regular cheesecake with white chocolate shavings and raspberry sauce. That was not what I was expecting.",negative
ch194,1/4/2014,revch501,2,"I find WCG to noisy for my taste and we tend to avoid it because the wait can be prohibitive -- when we try to make reservations (for six), it is a chore.

We have visited WCG at least a dozen times and always had a great meal.

Our favorites: filet Cobb, honey carrots, BBQ bacon burger!!!

The only bad thing I've had here is their house margarita, which is made with a mix not fresh lime! Ew",positive
ch194,12/26/2013,revch504,4,To get more detailed I would give it a 3.7. The highlight of this place are the drinks and desserts. The meals are above average but it wasn't as great as I expected it to be.,positive

The food is delicious and the portions are generouse, service has always been perfect, and the restaurant itself is beautiful.  I've had Maytag burger  (blue cheese) served with spaghetti squash, wow, (I'm not even the biggest burger fan) it was incredible.

I cannot wait to try more on the menu along with the desserts which im really bummed we did not get to try.  The chicken crepes were out of this world with the honey carrots.  I tried replicating and could not even come close to how good those were. Mouth watering goodness. Make sure if you get fries to get the house ranch they also happen to make from scratch its unbelievable.  If I win the lottery I would eat here every day and not get sick of it!",positive
ch194,11/14/2013,revch510,4,Citrus soy salmon is my favorite. You should try the couscous. Best in town. It's a little noisy but worth the trip. I did my reservation through open table and got on at the time promised. They serve bottomless drinks.,positive
ch194,11/13/2013,revch511,4,"I went with my servers choice while visiting this restaurant, I ended up having the soy salmon. It was definitely a great choice and was delicious to the last bite but was kind of on the expensive side. The interior of this restaurant is gorgeous, the staff was a little bit on the slow side though.",positive
ch194,11/10/2013,revch512,5,This place is great I had the most amazing salmon there with a citrus sauce and i was cooked perfectly like seriously if you've never been go to this place for your next date night!,positive
ch194,11/10/2013,revch513,4,"Visiting from out of town, and this might have been the best tasting food in this town.

At first, I made a reservation for 730 and arrived 10 minutes early, but our table wasn't even ready at 730 :/ I understand your restaurant is busy, but when you accept reservations, have some available tables. 

Our server, Brian, however, is probably the best spirited guy we met waiting tables! He was funny, responsive, and checked up on us constantly. 

On the other hand, the food was pretty good--hot and tasty. It wasn't super excellent, but satisfying. I had the balsamic rib eye steak, fish, and rack of ribs from here. (We all shared. I didn't order 3 plates lol) All flavorful and cooked perfectly. There was something off however; for the number of people that eat there, you'd think it'd actually be more gourmet, but the taste is anything but. 

I did order a cocktail, the key lime martini...don't order it. It's like a milky vodka with graham cracker on the rim; sadly, the cracker was the best part of that drink. 

The dessert, however, is excellent. Sweet and delicious for those that have a sweet tooth. And they go well with tea and coffee ;) 

I would say this place is the best in the area for ordering American :)",positive
ch194,11/7/2013,revch514,5,"Love this place, yummy menu! I went here a few times before and liked my food but wasn't in love with anything until I discovered their filet cob salad and now I am hooked!!! I crave it all the time. Steak is cooked perfectly and the salad is huge and has a little bit of everything in it. I also am a big fan of the grilled artichoke appetizer and of course like the name says they have a great brownie dessert!",positive
ch194,11/3/2013,revch515,4,"Wow!  We were impressed.  A great lunch place.  Not sure we would do dinner, but definitely a movie lunch or dessert post movies.  I had a salad.  Ahi tuna was pretty good too.  It has a nice chic vibe inside too.",positive
ch194,10/30/2013,revch516,4,We mostly go for happy hour. It has a good one. Last visit I was the only person at the table of four who exclusively consumed happy hour fare. I love the slider plate. It is three little burgers in different styles. Others had sandwiches from the menu. They all love the cous cous side and an order of the cooked carrots was shared by the table. I was the only drinker. I like the happy hour martinis. The others had ice tea or Arnold Palmer. Dessert was good too but not a happy hour item. The regular menu has some great entree salads and excellent meat dishes. I have enjoyed them in the past.  Service was not too good at first but her shift ended 15 minutes after we arrived. From there service improved dramatically. We will continue as customers. It is a great place!,positive
ch194,10/29/2013,revch517,4,"Pros - The food was great and prices in the $$-$$$ range. A good variety of foods as well; something for everyone. Our party had the AZ eggrolls, the chicken crepes, filet mignon cobb salad, the NY strip and the white ras. cheesecake. The salad was very large, easy to share with 2... the steaks were done as ordered, the chicken crepes I was told were so-so and the cheesecake was very rich and easy to share with 4. 
The service was also very good; quick and kind server... came back to the table several times to check on us.
Cons - The only con for us was the noise level. We sat near the semi-enclosed open kitchen area so we really had to talk loudly to hear each other from across the table. Noise seems to carry here just because of the large layout and high ceilings.
I would certainly go back again... perhaps just request to be seated away from the kitchen area, especially if you are with any soft spoken people.",positive
ch194,10/27/2013,revch518,5,One of my favorite restaurants by far!!! They have an awesome gluten free menu and a gluten free desert that is to die for!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! The restaurant itself is beautiful and the bar area is so unique. You just can't take your eyes off of it. The way they have the bottles organized on the wall with the lighting is awesome and an art piece in itself. The service there is always top notch which is a plus for me. Its probably a good thing that I don't live closer because I would be in there everyday. lol Love this place.,positive
ch194,10/23/2013,revch519,5,"Nice atmosphere, not too bright. Ate on the patio which was covered and very comfortable at 7pm. Had the blackened mahi with crab sauce.

ch194,10/21/2013,revch520,5,"I first came here on my first day of work.  My managers took me out to lunch and all seemed to really love this place.  I got the filet mignon cobb salad, amazing! Honestly it's the best salad I've ever had.. it has a lot going on.  Along with the filet it comes with hardboiled egg, cherry tomatos, mushrooms, greens, croutons, and blue cheese (I get it without this).  The dressing was a bit overwhelming so I would suggest getting it on the side.  I have yet to try something else.  I will be sure to update once I do!",positive
ch194,10/17/2013,revch521,5,"A wonderful place for dinner in north scottsdale.  Particular highlights include the mayo burger and steak sandwich. Great baked crab cakes, and the most excellent appetizer in maricopa county...the venerable Arizona egg rolls!",positive

ch194,10/9/2013,revch524,3,"I ate here twice this week while I was in Scottsdale on business. I always try to stop at White Chocolate Grill when in Scottsdale. Service is great. Sometimes too fast between courses and I have had to send food back so I could relax between courses. Not sure if they kept it warm or prepared fresh. They always appear to have sufficient staff and they are always busy. Watch the bill as they like to up charge for ""rocks"" in your cocktail even if not ordered straight up. Not a big deal but annoying.",negative
ch194,10/7/2013,revch525,5,"This has now become my go-to restaurant when visiting Phoenix! In fact, we went out of our way to come here last week because we knew it would be a 5-star experience.

My new favorite salad in the world is the seared ahi tuna with ginger and sesame dressing - it could not be more perfect! We also ordered the crab cakes (light and fluffy) and of course, shared a dessert. The dessert was a little rich for my liking, but it was to be expected from a place with Chocolate in the name. 

Hope I get to come back again! I don't mean to be predictable but obviously I will be ordering the Tuna!",positive
ch194,10/7/2013,revch526,5,"My mom and I went twice in one day! It is soo good. First we got the az eggrolls, mashed potatoes with good gravy, summer corn salad, and the banana cream pie. Everything was fantastic!! The jalapeño cream sauce that comes with the eggrolls goes with it perfectly. 

That night we went back for the bread pudding which I will dream about it is that good!",positive

ch194,9/20/2013,revch528,3,"Been here once before, though it'd been awhile so we stopped in on a Thursday evening (missed the Restaurant Week promotion by two days, but oh well).  One of the first things you'll notice inside is the bar with liquor bottles stacked to the top of the ceiling.  Cool and colorful little aesthetic touch.  The seating and atmosphere otherwise though is tough to distinguish from the other various finer dining establishments in the Scottsdale area.

We started off with the spinach and artichoke dip.  Gotta say I was less than impressed with it.  Generally I prefer this type of dip to be thicker and heartier, but the dip was pretty runny watered down for my taste.  It was passable, but unimpressive.  For the entrée I went on the lighter side got the citrus soy salmon and couscous.  Pretty good overall as the salmon was cooked adequately and the couscous was light and subtle.  For dessert my girlfriend and I tried two things.  We got the bread pudding and the white chocolate brownie.  Now these did not disappoint.  The white chocolate brownie was decadent, flaky, flavorful, and dense.  The bread pudding was huge and had croissants as the bread which gave it a great texture.

Overall I give this place a so-so rating for a couple of reasons.  As mentioned earlier, the atmosphere is relatively blah.  It's nice, but other than the bar setup, there's nothing unique or interesting about it.  The appetizer and entrée were good, but not worth the fairly pricey tab that came with them in my opinion.  The desserts though are very impressive and are worth saving room for.  And our server was very friendly and attentive.  If the rest of the experience matched the desserts, I'd give it a 5 star rating.  In the case though, I didn't feel we always got adequate value for the price.",negative
ch194,9/19/2013,revch529,5,"I've eaten here with gusto it was so good.  Can't remember what I had a year ago, but I had a Maytag blue cheese burger (which was so melted on the burger I actually asked where the cheese was, but you sure could taste it..yum!) and it was superb!  Came with a big whopping hunk of homemade cut fries--which I certainly didn't need but loved scarfing down like a hog!  Just fabulous quality of food here.
Their meat--and I mean the hamburger quality--is excellent, too, for what America offers (nothing compares to the beef in Argentina where I just returned from).
Love this place so much told the son to take a date there if he wants to impress her with good food.  Atmosphere is nice, service was great, just love this place!
One of my very fav places to eat here in Phoenix for sure under $20 each!  Yummy delicious food here!!!",positive
ch194,9/18/2013,revch530,4,"Ok I am a fan.  First of all, great job with the name.  It's catchy and peaks your attention.  

I came here with 2 co-workers after a day at the office.  None of us live in Phoenix so we found this place through Yelp and loved the name.  Plus it got good reviews.

The interior of this restaurant looks very expensive.  Darker woods, an expansive bar, an open kitchen.   It's very clean and crisp and you feel as if you may be sitting in an exclusive steak house.

The menu is wonderful!  Tons of fresh soups, salads, sandwiches, and entree's to choose from.  I love this fresh, upscale American dining experience and The White Chocolate Grill nails it.   The prices are unbelievably reasonable for where you are and what you are getting.  I got the rotisserie chicken because they described it on the menu with ""really good gravy"".  Again, great marketing because we all know that really good gravy can make your whole meal.  

It was wonderful.  The chicken was perfectly seasoned and tender and juicy, and the gravy was, in fact, really good.   I also had a few bites of the chicken tortilla soup and loved every slurp.

I was too full to order dessert which kind of upset me because I was looking forward to trying the white chocolate banana cream pie.   Although I would have had to unbutton my pants, I hear it's worth it.",positive
ch194,9/18/2013,revch531,5,"This place was a rare find!  Yes it's been there for a while, but I never see it when hitting the Harkins for some R & R.  My girlfriend and I were looking to have sushi at that place down the parking lot, but they weren't open yet. So we said ""hey let's try this place"" and walked into WCG.

First thoughts.. ""ok this looks kinda nice and fancy""   The hostess was really nice and sat us quickly.  The waiter came over and got us drinks pretty fast and was also really nice and helpful. 

Looking over the menu I wanted something light but also something that i was familiar with, so I went with a simple club sandwich.  

Let me tell you history with club sandwiches for a moment. Every time I have one at other places, they are always the same.  One sandwich, cut into different triangles, stacked 5"" tall with a tooth pic in each slice.  That's fine.  Many places are also dry.

How does WCG do it?  They use one whole sandwich, stack it high with FRESH ingredients, slice it ONCE in half and it also comes with a nice side sauce (forgot the kind).  I also got a side of fries with it. I don't think in the history of having club sandwiches, have I ever verbally made a noise when eating a sandwich.  My girlfriend even commented to me ""Enjoying your food?""  

It was THE best club I've had.  

She got a spicy chicken sandwich that she really enjoyed too!  

Then we actually got dessert.  We had their cheesecake and it was the best we've had.  Yes.. better than Cheesecake Factory.

We've been here twice now and it's now a favorite of ours.",positive
ch194,9/11/2013,revch532,1,"Well it has been a week since I dined at the WCG and had a bad situation. I sent the Managing Partner an email that evening expressing my concerns. By the way the Managing Partner has his email printed on the front of their menus. You would think that after a week someone would respond to my concerns....BUT NO!

My email stated that while dining at the bar I had two insects crawl across my bar napkin in front of my Prime Rib dinner as well as a dead fruit fly. I asked for my check and to bag most of my dinner up to take home to my dogs. The server just shrugged her shoulders when I said I wasn't happy with the uninvited pests. On the way out I looked for a Manager but only two hostesses were at the front desk who were busy seating customers.

ch194,9/9/2013,revch534,2,"A disappointing evening at the white chocolate grill. Apps were good, my salad was fresh and tasty and the bread pudding dessert was amazing. Unfortunately my balsamic ribeye came out completely raw.. I ordered it medium rare and it wasn't even close. I mentioned it to our server who agreed with me and took it away. I would have been happy if they offered me a free dessert at this point but they put the already thin piece of meat back on the grill, burnt it and brought it back out with some fresh rice and fresh balsamic drizzled on it. I assumed a new steak was coming but I paid 26 bucks for an entree that was minimally edible both times it was brought out. I was surprised because I have had good experiences here in the past, and I should know better than to order a steak in a non-steakhouse..its my fiance/professional chef who insists I complain.. I just can't imagine Ruth's or Mastro's putting a served raw steak back on the grill, burning it to a crisp and re-serving it..",negative

The food was just as outstanding as my first experience in Denver. I ordered the same thing: the spit roasted turkey dip with honey roasted carrots. There is a wonderful wild mushroom sauce that goes with the sandwich and I ate every bite. This is amazing considering I have a strong dislike for mushrooms. Yes, it is that GOOD!

We also had the white chocolate brownie which was so rich that we could not finish it. It was very very tasty. I also had the white chocolate martini made with Godiva liqueur. Yummy! I will definitely go back next time I am in town!",positive

ch194,9/3/2013,revch538,5,Love the food but have issues with the service almost every time we come here.  Ahi tuna salad is amazing!  Filet Cobb salad is amazing!  Fire Roasted Turkey Dip is amazing - instead of gravy I sub out for the au jus from the french dip sandwich or you can just get the french dip... its amazing!  Got the burger once... just okay.. nothing special.  Love the very thin french fries and the garlic green beans are sometimes the daily vegetable... yummy in my tummy if I choose to sub out fries and be a little healthier.  People love the carrots... they are carmelized and sweet if you like that.  Definitely a must for just about anyone...  prices are mid to high.  Salads are Ahi - $13.99 and filet one is $15.99 during lunch.  Haven't been there for dinner so not sure about that.  Nice decor...  gives you a nice upscale feeling without being snobby.,positive
ch194,9/3/2013,revch539,4,Great food. Fantastic service - if its possible to have almost too good service it's here. Salad so good it didn't need dressing. Soup and salad combo huge. Must have been regular serving sizes. Really pretty interior.,positive
ch194,8/28/2013,revch540,5,This has really become our go to spot. The restaurant has a wonderful feel to it and the staff has always been great. We often bring friends and out of town guests here and everyone loves it. I have never had someone not like a meal they have ordered. The menu is extensive and prices are reasonable. I love the famous chicken salad and my husband goes crazy for their burgers. Be sure to save room for their banana cream pie! I don't like pie (or bananas really) but this is one of the most incredible desserts I have ever had!,positive
ch194,8/28/2013,revch541,3,"The food was good but definitely average. We waited a long time to put in our order, and it took just as long to order dessert and get our checks. The only above average part of our experience there was the white chocolate raspberry cheesecake. To die for!",negative

I've been here a few different times, and once got the chopped salad and the other got the club sandwich. Chopped salad was of decent portion size, however didn't have any wow factor. Club sandwich was a little better, but like I mentioned, nothing to be amazed about. 

One time I came here with my boyfriend and he ordered the filet mignon salad and said it was really good, which is a plus. 

Other than that, certainly average.",negative
ch194,8/24/2013,revch543,5,"I absolutely love this place. Excellent food and atmosphere. Anytime I'm in the area I eat there, and I have to sit by the bar (it's gorgeously designed). If you're looking to not spend a great deal of money just get a burger (and their white chocolate bread pudding!), they're delicious and worth it. 

Also, make sure you make a reservation in advance for Friday and Saturday nights because, it can get PACKED. 

Lastly, it's good for any night really, a family dinner, friends/ladies night, date night, etc. It's a classy place with style.

There usually isn't a wait during lunch time and I did have to wait only once during dinner time and the wait was only like 15 minutes. The service is great and the employees are always super nice! I was here about two months ago with my family for lunch and our order ticket got lost so the manager nicely came over and told us and said that he would be paying for our lunch. So nice! Shows how nice and how the employees care about their customer service! I always get the ""Spit Roasted Turkey Dip"" and it is awesome! The mashed potatoes are to die for and the mushroom dipping sauce the sandwich comes with is the best thing i've ever tasted! The prices can be a little pricey but it is worth it since the food is great, the service is great and the portions of meals are huge! Definitely will be coming back here a lot for great food!",positive

Had dinner here last night for my birthday because apparently several of my husband's coworkers highly recommended this place. I'm not sure what food they're used to that they consider this good, but I certainly did not. The highlight of our meal was the appetizer and the vegetable of the day. Other than that, it was barely edible. 

Starting with drinks, I had a pear martini and hubby had a Long Island iced tea. The martini was thick and excessively sweet. Tasted like cheap pancake syrup. The Long Island was standard, nothing great but not bad. Though I would suggest a different glass or maybe a different colored straw, because halfway through our meal someone walked by (not our waiter) and topped it off with regular iced tea before we could even say anything.

For an appetizer we ordered the shrimp cocktail. I'd say this is pretty hard to mess up, but what made it really great were the sauces. It came with cocktail sauce as well as a jalapeño sauce. They were both fantastic! I assumed they were made in house, but I guess it's quite possible that the 1 thing we liked wasn't even made in the restaurant. 

For dinner I ordered scallops (not on the menu, they were a special) with the vegetable of the day, and hubby had the BBQ trio with fries. 

My scallops were awful. They came atop a lemon beurre blanc.  Both the sauce and the scallops were cold, they were missing the beautiful sear that I expect to see on scallops, and they were undercooked (still slimy in the middle). The vegetable of the day was a corn salad. That was the only good thing on the plate. It had corn, tomatoes, zucchini and queso fresco and it was delicious. I plan to make it at home.

Hubby's BBQ trio was nothing special. It had pulled pork, ribs, and rotisserie chicken. The meats were cooked well, the problem was the BBQ sauce was sugary sweet. Not really to our liking. The side of fries was the worst part of the dish. The menu touts fresh cut fries, well let me tell you, what we got was a soggy, greasy pile of junk. They didn't even look appetizing. I wish I had gotten a picture of them just to see how many people might actually be willing to eat them. I'm sure not many. 

As far as decor goes, if you've ever been in a Firebirds, you've seen the inside of this place. Everything from the dark wood, to the open kitchen, to the back-lit liquor bottles at the bar. It's all the same. And the food at Firebirds is much better. 

The one positive I can speak to (and the only reason for giving 2 stars instead of 1) was the service. We had a reservation and we were seated very quickly even though we arrived 20 mins early. And our waiter was very attentive and friendly. 

Unfortunately, the food was so bad I don't expect to ever be back.",negative
ch194,7/31/2013,revch547,4,"Great food, great drinks...If you like Houston's, you'll like WCG.  I've had great meals in the dinning room, and great times in the bar as well!",positive
ch194,7/26/2013,revch548,4,"Overall, this was a good choice for a birthday dinner with my family!

In the distant past, I had visited this restaurant and found the service to be slow. I was reluctant to try it again however, with two munchkins under 8, options are limited. I can only visit Chili's or Red Robin so many times. 

Yes, it's décor is very Houstons-like and WCG reeks of its opening days when trendy hotties and desperate men with money would troll and try out the cocktails and food. Now, everyone is a little older and guess what they have now?! A CHILDREN'S MENU AND CRAYONS! If I was childless, I would lament the decline of Western Civilization. However, I was happy. And the kids were happy. And I had an awesome white chocolate martini and the mahi. My husband was content with his steak. My children devoured the white brownie desert. (So much for my birthday treat. ) I do have one complaint. The white pasta on the children's menu is just that, simply pasta and butter. The kids hated it, and instead shared a yummy cheeseburger.

Our beloved White Chocolate Grill has, like so many other restaurants of its ilk, succumbed to cheaping-out on happy hour, overcharging for popular menu items, and now hosts a waiter whom if this was 1920's Alabama, I'd shoot him, barbecue him up, and feed him to local law enforcement officials at their annual picnic.

White Chocolate, I've been patiently waiting for this joyous time of year, the time when faux-Arizonans mass exodus to their cool summer abodes just like rats jumping off a sinking freighter. This is when I come knocking, so I can have you all to myself. And you pull this shit?

We're FUCKING through White Chocolate. (and this FUCKING has nothing on my wife's, which had nothing on mine). 

DISCLAIMER

1.) I had just finished watching Office Space before heading out for happy hour.
      Bill Lundbergh was everywhere.

2.) I wouldn't really shoot anyone like the girl in Fried Green Tomatoes. I would
     however give them a savage tongue lashing, and not the Michael Douglas kind.

3.) My balls are detachable in situations such as this.

4.) I wish I'd taken the Rodeo Clown career path. Being gored a few times would 
     beat this.

Everything on the menu is delicious, the drinks are fantastic (they have a really extensive bourbon list) and the desserts are fantastic.  The ribs and rotisserie chicken is probably my favorite dish, but I've never had a bad meal here.  Highly recommended.",positive
ch194,6/3/2013,revch555,2,"My husband and I enjoy coming to WCG when we're in Phoenix however, this may be our last visit. We were in town over the long Memorial Day weekend on our way to the resort we stopped for lunch. I had the Flirtini which was good, we ordered the rib eye sandwich and the dip duo and it was all good. Our waitress was sweet, she had a great personality and took really good care of us. 

We decide to have dinner there on our last night in town, the shrimp cocktail was not cleaned properly and I proceeded to clean the shrimp myself and make a ""poop pile"" on the appetizer plate.  When our waiter (he had NO personality) came by my husband told him to let the chef know that this is unacceptable. He seemed unfazed so I interjected and said ""I love to cook and I would never serve that to a guest"" he mumbled something then walked off with the plate. We ordered the prime rib but they sold out. Okay, no problem bring us the rib/chicken platter with mashed potatoes. The chicken was dry and really had no flavor, the ribs were decent nothing to write home about. 

Our waiter comes back to check on us then leaves a dessert menu on the table when we just started to eat our dinner.  This is my husband's biggest pet peeve, if you ask my husband if he is interested in dessert and he has a plate full of food in front of him your tip just went down. If you ask him if he'd like a coffee or cappuccino when his glass is full of wine, your tip just went down.

Our waiter never came back, we had to ask someone else for our bill. The shrimp cocktail was not taken off of our bill nor was any apology from the manager or chef, no dessert was offered for having to clean the poop shoot of each and every shrimp we ate. 

Long story short, my husband left 0 tip and wrote the waiter a note saying the shrimp cocktail was $13 that would have been your tip but you didn't take the shrimp off of our bill, customers don't want to eat sh*t and shouldn't have to clean their own shrimp because the cook staff is too lazy.",negative

Completely same interior of Houstons, with exhibition kitchen seen through glass walls.

Service was decent, but food was really lacking.  Had the Balsamic ribeye with mashed potatoes and was disappointed.  Small portion and the portion of mashed potatoes was a joke, maybe two table spoons.  Granted we got in just before closing(which is the time to get the food quality shaft).  Steak tasted okay but it was tiny.

ch194,5/28/2013,revch560,2,"This place is unique.

I don't really care or observe these kind of things, but the interior looked pretty nice. I am saying this in the manliest way possible. The ceiling was my favorite part of the entire place.

The food choices was typical, salad, sandwiches, burgers, meat and seafood.

I had the jambalaya and my girlfriend at the pork.

3 things...
1) The portion was tiny for the price, everything is averaging $15 if you exclude the seafood etc, but you you see more plate than food.
Tip: Use smaller plates, it will give the illusion there is more food

2)The food wasn't that great, yardhouse or cheesecake factory tastes WAY better (I didn't think I would ever write that)

3) Dessert was good, but it really wasn't that great, I was expecting it to blow my mind considering it is called ""white chocolate grill"" Their white chocolate isn't anything special.

Also, it was my birthday, and my girlfriend asked if they did anything and the waitress said, ""We can put a candle in it,"" as she tilted her head at an awkward 45 degree angle and smiled at me. I almost choked on my water because I got scared from her smile. That and felt insulted like I needed a candle, I'm in my mid 20s man! I said no, but she put a candle on my dessert anyways, how kind of her.

 I didn't really mind, since it was my birthday, I didn't have to pay. hahaha. But still, it was the first time I been to a restaurant that never offered anything on a birthday. Pretty ghetto for a place that gives off such an expensive vibe.

All in all, the interior is nice, it gives a snobby vibe. So it tricks you into thinking the food will be amazing. But it is overpriced and not good and small portions.

I should have just went to bobby q or yardhouse or something. I wouldn't come back here. 2 stars for the nice ceiling. Go ceiling",negative

I would have liked to sit at a table since there was 6 of us but they put us in a huge booth.  Spencer our waiter was real nice but seem a bit nervous.  You can order bread but you must ask for it to get it,  nice hot bread with warm butter plus we had the spinach dip with nachos and the artichoke with cheese.  The artichoke was overpriced @ $10. so do not get it was not worth it, plus had no taste and was very bland.  The filet salad is huge and 2 people can share it, the pork loin was melt in your mouth.  The NY Strip is a solid 10oz and huge.  It was a bit tough, tougher than I am used to so next time I will order the Filet.  I was not happy with the fact that Atlantic Salmon sold for close to $19. and you can buy it for less than $3.00 a pound also the fact they did not tell their customers Atlantic Salmon is farm raised and loaded with chemicals, preservatives and anti-biotics.  No respectable restaurants should even serve farm raised Atlantic salmon, it is very unhealthy and linked to numerous diseases..  I was looking forward to the bread pudding but was very disappointed.  It was very sweet and just okay nothing to rave about.  I have made better bread pudding as well as you can get much better bread pudding else where.  The apple pie dessert is big enough for 4 people - some desserts are bigger than others and some are only big enough for one person. I would go back to try something else, like the chicken crepes or the filet.  The couscous was real good and the first time I had it.  The service was great.  The cost well - for the 6 of us - 5 adults and one child, the children's menu was great - 1/2 slab of ribs, with fries and a drink for only $5.99 - awesome...the total price with tip for the 6 of us was about $200..",positive

I wanted to like the place so much, the name just spoke to me with my love of all things white chocolate, but it seems I will have to find a way to convince myself to give them one more chance to redeem themselves...

I'll tell myself that this time I should cut them some slack because it was not only Valentine's Day, but our reservation was so late, at 9:30pm. I'll tell myself that this time I had a migraine and, yeah, we ordered with a few minor changes to accommodate our personal tastes and dietary / allergy needs... (Could she please substitute Monterey Jack for the Pepper Jack and please no mayo on the chicken sandwich... And could I please have either avocado or guacamole instead of the mayo on my burger? Which one? Guacamole, please. Thank you.)

Did we get seated fast after arriving early and there being more than a dozen people waiting for seating before us? Was both our hostess and server polite and perform professionally? Did the food arrive quickly and presented nicely? Was the atmosphere pleasant and tasteful? Was the food delicious? All these are ""Yes""

Was the food prepared correctly? Well, not entirely. The burger was served with avocado rather than the requested AND confirmed guacamole, however, it was also served with the dressing still on it. Minor and easy mistake really, but was really expecting ""perfection"" after seeing the ruthless corporate efficiency with which this restaurant is run during our short time there. Oh... and the fries (ugh- shoestring), while seemingly homemade, well, they left much to be desired- at least more than the messy scattering of limp, greasy potatoes that adorned our plates (sans the ketchup which one must order with their food- we did).

Am I being a tad harsh? Probably. The problem, though, is that my previous visit several years ago was marred by two pretty major issues... My mother chose to treat me to my birthday dinner at WCG- she arrived earlier than I did and was directed that she should sit in the bar area to wait for me. Mom sat directly at the bar top and when asked what she would like to drink, requested a margarita. Her bartender flitted away without further conversation and returned a few moments later with her beverage.

I arrived and joined her at the bar top, whereupon I asked what she was drinking, and she informed me a ""regular margarita, nothing special""... I inquired whether she had asked for something specific- be it by drink name or alcohol brand / variety- since I had also picked up the tab in front of her to pay it so we could move to a table for dinner and saw a check for nearly $20! She confirmed she had said nothing more than ""margarita"" and the bartender had not made any suggestions, let alone ask if she wanted something more than a simple ""well"" margarita. Nice way to take advantage of your guest, not to mention one who is a senior citizen.

After paying the tab, we had the hostess arrange a table for us and we were seated promptly. Dinner plans came to a screeching halt within minutes, sadly- I'm a vegetarian and there was nothing, save one salad, the chips & salsa appetizer, and dessert (at the time, not a one made with white chocolate, consequently...) on the menu for me to order. We inquired of our server whether there were any items on the menu which could be made vegetarian-safe and were told, after she had gone to the kitchen to verify, that the menu items I mentioned were the only ones available- others could NOT be modified (?)

Needless to say, we left and ended up having a nice meal at The Blue Agave Mexican restaurant in the same complex.

So, one star for the first visit, a generous four for the second visit- weighted average of three stars given. Let's hope the third time's a charm...",negative
ch194,2/9/2013,revch587,5,"Really good food. Fair prices. Nice decor. Bar area is really nice. Service was solid.
Upscale casual in scottsdale",positive
ch194,2/6/2013,revch588,5,"What a dinner.

I picked this place because it was very close to my house, and the reviews on Yelp were relatively good. I am only disappointed that I didn't try it sooner. The wait staff, hostesses, runners and bartenders were friendly, courteous and quick to smile; everybody seemed genuinely eager and happy to take care of the guest's needs. The ambiance is trendy casual without crossing the line to pretentious. The lighting is warm and inviting but low enough to still provide an intimate feel, and the dark woods used throughout the restaurant help lend a subtle sophistication to the atmosphere.

The menu is quite large and can be almost overwhelming, with entrees ranging from salads and sandwiches to burgers and steaks. My date and I decided to start out with an appetizer and, although the guacamole and chilled cheese with chip special sounded good, opted for their shrimp cocktail.

The shrimp were perfectly cooked and served with a cocktail sauce and a mayonnaise-based jalapeño sauce. The cocktail sauce was really horseradish heavy, which we both loved, and really tangy. The mayo sauce seemed odd, as I thought it was tartar sauce, but turned out to be a very good, subtle accompaniment to the shrimp. It was so good, in fact, we were dipping our forks into it and taking bites of the lettuce garnish from the plate. The staff also added an extra shrimp (the menu said seven were served) because there were two of us sharing.

For dinner I chose the bleu cheese crusted tenderloin, rare, with broccoli as a side. The steak was cooked right on the border of bleu, which is how I think a rare steak should be served. The bleu cheese was slightly melted over the top of the steak, forming a cap, and then either brûléed or browned under a salamander. The meat was tender, moist, well seared, and more flavorful than most tenderloins I've had. The broccoli was also very well cooked, sitting in that zone right between crunchy and soft, and very well seasoned.

My date had the Ono in a light citrus bur blanc and honeyed carrots. The fish was wood grilled perfectly and the sauce added a bit of needed fat and acid without overpowering the subtle flavor of the fish. The honeyed carrots... Wow; the carrots were fantastic.

For dessert, two caramel lattes and the gluten free chocolate soufflé cake. The coffees were stellar, and the texture of the cake had me doubting it was gluten free. The chocolate was extremely rich, still warm, and the cool creme anglaise was a delicious counterpoint to the dark, earthy chocolate.

I've had dinners half as good at three times the price. An impressive first outing to the White Chocolate Grill. I'll be going back again soon.",positive
ch194,1/31/2013,revch589,4,"It was a good experience, only because we were smart enough to get a reservation while the car auction was going on nearby.  My meal was very good, ribs/chicken/pork combo.  My friend got the pork sandwich and her pork was not the same or nearly as good as was in my combo.

The prices were a bit high is all.  Pinnacle Peak Patio has as good BBQ food and for half the price.

ch194,1/29/2013,revch590,5,"Stumbled upon this amazing spot on my recent business trip - Everything about it was exceptional. The ambiance is very cool, almost swanky. The highly attentive and well trained staff look like they were hand picked from a J.Crew catalog.  Bar area is stadium seating with cool high ceilings, and comfortable plush  leather seats.  Even the bathrooms were minimalist class in stone grey w/recessed candle cubbies. 

Food is as amazing as the ambiance - Cajun Chicken sandwich was one of the best I've had. Reportedly good burgers with melted in to patty cheese and salads. It was so good on my last day and given there are many other eateries to try in the area I was drawn back to the same place to see if they could repeat the performance.  

They did and it was actually even better - amazing team service - awesome steak and turkey sandwich and some unidentifiably delicious mashed potatoes and mystery gravy. 

Really impressive - I will be back",positive
ch194,1/28/2013,revch591,1,My husband and I come into the restaurant about twice a month. We love the ambiance and the food.

One of the instances happened to be tonight. I happen to be a restaurant manager and this is unacceptable. I will be making sure that the owner will know about my experience tonight. I will not be returning to the restaurant and I will making sure my friends know about this.,negative
ch194,1/22/2013,revch592,3,"We've been to White Chocolate Grill two or three times before this visit. I like the ambiance and I love the food. They have a nice selection to satisfy the vegetarians  and carnivores in my family. The latest visit, however, prompted my us to never return.

We made a reservation on the patio since the inside tables for a party of five were already booked. They said the patio was heated and has a fireplace. Great! 

On arrival, we were seated underneath a spinning ceiling fan next to an idle heater. The waitress tried in vain to fire up the heater and could not turn off the fan. They turned on the overhead heaters for awhile then they mysteriously turned off. Why?

The patio was also a little dark; several wall sconces had burned out bulbs. This immediately put us in a bad mood. Although the food was really good, we suffered through dinner with our jackets on. We could not move to the empty table next to the fireplace because it was ""reserved."" Consequently, the fireplace table was never occupied! 

White Chocolate Grill - get your act together. Check your lights, heaters, and fans BEFORE you seat people on the patio. The table next to us complained as well so it wasn't just my problem. Perhaps you had unforeseen technical problems. I at least expected an apology from the manager or some freebie for our discomfort. You delivered neither and lost a customer.",negative

Service has always been very good and its one of the few places I order dessert at, always enjoying their bread pudding (which I normally don't like).

I tried their GF grilled artichokes and holy crap were they delicious. Seasoned well with a yummy aioli sauce. Seriously would make a trip way the hell up north just to eat those again.

For my entree I had the GF burger. Unfortunately, it was just a burger with no bun, I was kind of hoping it would either be wrapped in lettuce or they would have a GF bread. But, it was good. Their french fries have so much potential, they were shoestring and cooked perfectly, but had almost no seasoning. All they need to do is throw a little seasoning on those puppies and they would be fantastic. 

Service and management were really great. They gave us a free dessert (GF souffle) because we had a little incident with another patron. It had nothing to do with them, but they apologized for it and gave us the dessert, which I thought was really nice. And the fact that they remembered I was doing the GF thing was really cool.

The steak was seasoned well and tasty.  My only issue is it was very small.  It might have been 6oz., no more, possibly less.  It was smothered in Maytag blue cheese.  The fries were also solid.

Our hotel room sink water tastes better than that. The food came so late as if they left to catch the fish we were going to consume. The waitress then forgot to put in one of our rolls and apologized in the most stand offish way possible saying it was a ""human error"" as if she wasn't even sorry about it.

I was very impressed with this place. My sister and I dined here for a girls night and they took such great care of us. We got a seat with a view, when it was packed. The manager comped our dessert, just cause. Literally, I would give them 10 stars if I could.
It seemed like the type of place to take care of their regulars, and locals. 
A couple of the dishes that stood out to me were the Jumbo Shrimp, and King Crab fried rice. 
The shrimp was served with potato style chips, and a creamy sauce. I am still wondering what was in that sauce. It had a savory, yet sweet honey butter flavor. So delicious. 
The crab fried rice just hit the spot. There were huge chunks of crab, and the dish was packed with flavor. No need to add soy or hot sauce to this one. 
There were a dozen or so sushi options, and a variety of small sharable plates, or full size entrees. 
Park valet at the Forum Shops to avoid the tourist traffic. From food, to service, and even price, I was highly impressed all around. I can't wait to return.",positive

I would recommend getting a window seat, especially in the evening, when the lights are up.

Service was mixed; the greeter / host was really nice and engaged, but our waiter was somewhat absent.  It seemed he was covering a lot of the floor himself, but still.

The sushi itself was very well presented.  We got the chef's selection, which had some intriguing and tasty combinations - I'd recommend going that way.  Oh yeah - the Wagyu pot stickers are almost worth another star by themselves.

We made it with about 15 minutes to spare and were able order our meal, happy hour prices and all!

Said prices were around half off, and hand rolls were cheaper than cut rolls, but are not great for sharing. The rolls were a good size and the fish was good quality. I have found few places that use real crab in their CA rolls and luckily Sushi Roku's were on the money!

My favorite rolls of the night were tuna / avocado, tempura sweet potato, rock shrimp / jalapeño, & spicy scallop  (which I absolutely had to try because it was new & exciting).

The iced tea had some sort of fruit flavor that we couldn't place. It wasn't sweet, but you could taste something tropical. 
I opted for the lunch special which included salmon teriyaki, salad, rice and sashimi. I also added a miso soup. My friend ordered a specialty roll and a seaweed salad. My expectations were actually kind of low (this place is inside a mall) and they were easily surpassed by this lunch. The miso soup was flavorful and served at an appropriate temperature. My friends salad was really delicious. It was made with the very dark green seaweed and not the weird neon kind. My salad was pretty generic and with the exception of fishing out and munching on the the bitter micro-greens, I basically left it untouched. My sashimi was ok. Nothing really special. It could've been a bit colder. My salmon teriyaki was very flavorful, but a tiny bit overcooked. The rice on the plate was plain steamed rice. It was exactly as expected. My friends roll looked pretty good, but towards the end, she just took it apart and ate the fish because the ratio of rice to other ingredients was too high.

ch225,10/6/2014,revch630,3,This place describes itself as forward thinking and the new face of sushi. Well if this is the new face of sushi we are going back in time with Marty McFly. The sushi was mediocre to put it nicely. Luckily I had a gift card to use so i didn't pay much. I will give it that it had a great view. But when the sushi came out it tasted like it had a bit of Clorox on it from cleaning the plate but then rubbed off on the sushi. Very unlikely I will want to come here again unless forced.,negative
ch225,10/6/2014,revch631,5,"It was a nice surprise when we found out that they have lunch special! Bento box with teriyaki salmon and 4 pieces of sashimi priced at $19, super delicious! My friend ordered unagi donburi and it was to die for, sweet and melt in your mouth eel! Service was excellent! I recommend to go during lunch time if you come to town with kids, it was nice, quite and still great food and service!",positive

ch225,9/22/2014,revch634,5,"We ate here on a Friday night as part of a group of fourteen from Vision Expo and the food and service was excellent! The friendly, professional service staff brought out many unique, tasty dishes and all of us walked away very satisfied. We were seated in a private area that looked out on the Strip, which created a very nice atmosphere.",positive
ch225,9/21/2014,revch635,4,Went here for lunch and got the beef teriyaki lunch bento. The beef was very tender and good!,positive
ch225,9/20/2014,revch636,4,I had the truffle edamame and they were delish. The truffle tempura roll wasn't as truffley as I'd like. The salmon truffle carpaccio was good but not very truffley either. And the lobster roll was really meaty!,positive
ch225,9/16/2014,revch637,4,"Happy hour! :) For food and drinks, but I only had water here. The water itself was deng sexy. LOL. Lemon placed in the cup with a toothpick, you wouldn't feel like it's just water.

The happy hour items had was:
 - Filet Mignon Wrapped Asparagus w/Soy Mirin: It was good! The sauce and juice from the meat thinly wrapped around 4 stalks (two halved asparagus) was delicious. The asparagus was cooked, but still had it's crunch in the center. (HH: $6)
 - A2 Fusion: consists of albacore, onion, avocado & jalapeno. One of the best rolls I've had in a while. (HH: $5)

You'd get more with sushi roll, $4 handroll isn't worth the quantity.

Decor was simple, had a hint of modern, and even thought it's in Vegas, felt like I was in California, if that makes any sense. LOL

For Happy Hour, you'd have to sit in a designated spot. Only minus 1 star, because I had to sit with people who were trash talking about Asians at the same table. It's not their fault, but I wasn't able to move from the table to another spot to avoid hearing them continuously bash on my culture. Made my eating a bit awkward.",positive
ch225,9/14/2014,revch638,1,was here on labour day.  had my money stolen.  staff unhelpful; manager inexperienced and unprofessional; used to frequent often for the mediocre but reasonably priced happy hour menu.  will never return.  advise patrons to hold on to keep their bags close.  horrible experience.  try ra sushi instead for a decent happy hour menu.,negative
ch225,9/12/2014,revch639,5,"Wow, is all I can say, the priced are phenomenal cheap for happy hour, the well drinks,  only $5, for drinks that usually cost $15, the portions are small but to taste all the food it's delicious, we ordered the fried calamari,   delicious and lightly fried,  we ordered the popcorn shrimp,  first time they were not lightly fried as well...really yummy, but the best food was the mini doughnuts to die for, for only$3, tasted like Mochi, balls...will definitely be back here.",positive

ch225,9/7/2014,revch641,5,Tuna Carpaccio and tuna tataki sushi was fresh and delicious! Celebrated a birthday here! Friendly wait staff and sushi chef! Highly recommended!!!,positive
ch225,8/30/2014,revch642,3,"We ate here mainly because the online menu looked like ""normal"" sushi. Although when we got there, it was mostly Japanese entrees with some sushi. I personally like the Americanized sushi rolls that contain very little raw fish. I know that's not what real sushi is, but I'd rather not eat a moving octopus.  Anyways, they had some good stuff. We had the Crunchy Tuna roll and the Katana roll. The Crunch roll was amazing, it had spicy tuna inside. The Katana roll had raw tuna on the top that was like warm, not a fan of warm raw fish. But it looked nice. 

The atmosphere was interesting. It was super dark inside like a fancy restaurant but the techno music was so loud that I couldn't  have a conversation at all. The staff was super nice and very helpful though. 

Did I like it?; sort of. Would I come back?: No.",negative
ch225,8/30/2014,revch643,4,"Extremely tasty, nice ambiance, and good #customerservice. However, small rolls, can be a bit pricey, but a cute little date spot.",positive

The prices and food are okay, though",negative
ch225,8/25/2014,revch647,4,"The baked lobster rolls was amazing! We really liked everything we tried. Great food, great view. Service was a bit slow. They took a while to come by when we wanted to order more food. The view to the Strip was awesome.",positive
ch225,8/23/2014,revch648,4,"We had miso soup, crab dynamite roll and the sushi mix with spicy tuna roll.  The spicy tuna roll tasted very fresh.  Miso soup was also excellent!  In comparison, the food prices seemed very reasonable.",positive
ch225,8/21/2014,revch649,5,"Day 2 of my four day getaway in Vegas.  I try to eat at a good sushi restaurant wherever I visit and Sushi Roku was well rated everywhere.  I was not disappointed in my expectations.  I asked for a seat with a view of the strip and was obliged with a great view looking south down Las Vegas Blvd.  

I ordered the chef's tasting menu, a sake sampler, and a cocktail suggested by the waiter (muddled tangerine and cucumber with gin - Yummy!).  Each course in the tasting menu was brought out by one of the chef's and I was given an explanation of the food and its preparation.  

The appetizer course was amazing.  After two weeks it is hard to remember which each item was but I think the first item was a squid sashimi with olive oil and lemon.  The second item was a tuna tartar and the third item was a salmon sashimi.  Every item was sublime.

Course two was the hot appetizer.  This was a shrimp skewer with a mango salsa and a skewer with bacon wrapped cherry tomatoes.  Course three was a sashimi sampler with three types of tuna.  Beautiful presentation here.  Course four was perfectly seared scallop.  Course five was a sushi sampler with three pieces of tuna poke hand roll and 4 nigiri.  The salmon nigiri was the best salmon sushi I have ever tasted.  Course six was desert, a tiramisu with green tea infused lady fingers.  Heavenly.

Top rating in my book for service, view, ambiance, and most of all, the amazing food.",positive
ch225,8/21/2014,revch650,4,"I came here for Happy Hour last week. Got an $18 raspberry cocktail and two of the happy hour special sushi rolls for $4 each. Both of the ladies working at the bar were very nice and friendly, and my cocktail, while pricey, was also very good. The sushi was great. The salmon was perfectly fresh, and the tempura shrimp nicely cooked. Good rice, too. The lady next to me ONLY got happy hour food-- no alcohol at all-- and they were just as nice to her-- no grudging the lack of drink-buying. It's an attractive space and a pleasant Happy Hour environment. This place gets a thumbs-up by me.",positive
ch225,8/21/2014,revch651,4,Loved it.  Donald at the bar was awesome!!  Food was great.  Went for happy hour.  Great deal!  Great ambiance.,positive
ch225,8/17/2014,revch652,5,"Folks here are way cool. I asked the head chef Haruhiko 'Haru' Takeshita to freestyle our dinner and he said no problem!! Needless to say, this our second time eating here on this Vegas run!",positive
ch225,8/16/2014,revch653,5,"For our last night in Vegas, we were looking to do a show and a fancier dinner. And a show and a fancier dinner we did! Our first choice for dinner was booked out a month, so we fell back on our trusty old friend, sushi. This restaurant did not disappoint. My boyfriend made a reservation (just to be safe). We get there and we are promptly seated in the back room; the windows behind our table looked out over the strip. Everything was prompt - the service and the time frame in between ordering our drinks and food and those getting to the table. Not to mention the service was so friendly - for some reason, they speak in rather quiet tones, which normally would frustrate me (I'm mostly deaf) but for some reason, it contributed more to the already soothing atmosphere. It was very intimate and peaceful. My boyfriend got some sashimi, soup, and rolls (forget what, exactly) while I got a little bowl of rice and rolls. The food was great! Normally, I'd go into much more detail, but I'll just leave it at that and let you find out how good it is. Dessert (mochi) was also good, three flavors of your choosing and one piece (which is then halved) of each flavor. I appreciated this, so I could indulge my sweet tooth but not feel overwhelmed/too full from it. Overall, this is a romantic and peaceful restaurant, equally good for couples as well as groups. We went early (6 PM) so this probably helped out with the peacefulness a lot, but nonetheless, I highly recommend it.",positive
ch225,8/9/2014,revch654,4,We had a late afternoon reservation but not late enough. They only opened the seating area with a view at 5:00pm. We didn't make a big fuss. We had a very attentive and friendly waiter. Service was quick and the food was good. The only issue we had was their system didn't accept our American Express Serve card even though the funds were available.,positive
ch225,8/5/2014,revch655,4,"Great service, amazing Sushi, conveniently located in the Caesars palace shopping forum. I was thoroughly impressed with everything we had. Which included the Katana roll, Dynamite Roll (which was outstanding), rainbow roll, and various Sashimi.",positive
ch225,7/30/2014,revch656,3,"The Sushi was average. I found that the Eel/Avocado roll had muddy taste, like you sometimes get in catfish and talapia. Not the most appealing. 

The Truffeled Sea Bass was the highlight of the meal, pefectly cooked and delicious. 

The chicken fried rice and Soba noodles were average as well. Not my favorite sushi place, but a decent option if you are staying at Caesar's.",negative
ch225,7/30/2014,revch657,5,"I set up reservations for 2 for a birthday dinner. The service was excellent, they comp'd any dessert on the menu for the birthday and they even served the dish with a sparkler. I would highly recommend this restaurant for any occasion/dinner.",positive
ch225,7/26/2014,revch658,3,The food was good however it was overpriced.  we got there around 8 p and got right in.  We had 4 rolls and after the tip we paid $100. We only had water to drink.  Like I said the food was good but the cost was high.,negative
ch225,7/26/2014,revch659,4,Food was of the chain good. Couldn't give it 5 stars cause of the price and water tasted like hose water when I was a kid.,positive

ch225,7/15/2014,revch662,5,One of the best sushi places i have ever been to in my life!  This is honestly not an exaggeration as I tend to do that at times.  I was only in Vegas for three nights and I came here two out of the three.  Highly recommend and absolutely everything we ordered was amazing.  There was a special crunch spicy roll that was to die for.,positive
ch225,7/14/2014,revch663,5,"Sushi roku was one of the best restaurant choices we made while in Vegas. Although it was hard to find in the hotel/casino, the Ambiance and view were worth the walk. I had the tuna appetizer and popcorn shrimp along with a few rolls. Everything was awesome. One of our friends didn't like raw fish and still enjoyed the other menu items. From the sake to the salad, I would rave about this place. Next time I'm in Vegas, I will be sure to come back!!!!!",positive

I highly recommend Sushi Roku.",positive

ch225,7/2/2014,revch668,3,"I love sushi, it is my favorite food so I am always hoping to find a good sushi restaurant when I go to Vegas. This place was okay. I think I am just too spoilt going to Sushi Deli in San Diego which is hands down the best sushi place on earth. The sushi here was just okay to me. I got the black truffle roll because it sounded awesome and someone else suggested it on here. It tasted like absolutely nothing to me. It wasn't bad, it just tasted like crunchy cardboard. We also accidentally ordered cold sake which is quite possibly one of the grossest tasting things you could ever drink. Overall the sushi was fine, but I wouldn't come here again to be completely honest.",negative

For appetizers I would recommend the popcorn shrimp tempura (my favorite!) or the lobster tempura. Hot, crispy, and cooked just right, this appetizer has your mouth singing! For sushi, I love the lobster roll with miso sauce, and any type of sashimi is fresh and delectable. 

If you are a local, you know there are items that can be ordered off the menu. All are delicious, but the white lotus roll is my absolute favorite. 

If you are in the mood for some upscale sushi in a quiet environment with a great view of Vegas, Sushi Roku is for you. The only downfall is the price - a little steep, bit you truly do get what you pay for here.",positive
ch225,6/18/2014,revch671,4,"I ordered the crispy spicy tuna ($16) with chicken fried rice ($15), both were filling and well prepared. Service was great, ambiance was excellent. Well priced considering you're in Vegas.",positive

Water was always full and the food and other things we requested came in a timely matter.They accidentally forgot the birthday girl's dish, but was able to provide her with a free dish to make up for it. 

I got the Tako roll with the spicy octopus and salmon sashimi and both were delicious and tasted fresh. I also tried my friend's miso butter-fish dish wow! It was so soft and flavorful. 
The birthday girl got a trio of pastry dessert and a candle to blow out to make her birthday extra special. A nice finishing touch to a great dining experience.

Atmosphere was pretty nice too - upscale ambiance. I would return when I go back to Vegas.",positive
ch225,6/16/2014,revch673,5,Happy hour is the best. The sushi was so fresh and satisfying. For sushi I'd suggest this place and nobu only. Otherwise make your own at home. What an amazing meal!,positive

I ordered miso eggplant, stuffed chicken in mushroom, rock shrimp tempura hand roll, albacore sashimi with fried onion, spicy yellowtail cut roll.

ch225,5/28/2014,revch679,4,My fiance and I came to Sushi Roku while on a trip to Vegas. It was our first stop on our 3 day trip and we had a great time. The truffle oil edamame had good flavor and was different than what we typically order. Our waiter recommended the Yellowtail diced chilis appetizer and I thought it was perfect! My fiance did not care for it but he enjoyed the sushi. I felt the sushi was average. Our waiter was very helpful and professional. We also requested for a window seat to look out over the strip which they accommodated. We had a great time and will be returning on our next trip!,positive

ch225,5/22/2014,revch681,2,Pretty average sushi nothing too special. The restaurant was pretty empty on Wednesday night. We ordered multiple roles the best role what's a spicy tuna the little piece of jalapeno on top of each roll. I've had a lot better sushi at better prices but I guess this is what you can expect in Vegas. At least I can say the fish tasted fresh,negative
ch225,5/21/2014,revch682,2,"Went here during a visit to Vegas. Debated the oh-toro (fatty tuna) out loud and even our server commented that it was great and ""just melts in your mouth"". Ended up ordering 2 orders (4 pieces) of it along with our entrees.

The tuna we had looked like they were less than ideal cuts. Not only did they taste bad, they were likely the worst tuna I've ever had. A complaint to our server simply resulted in her shaking her head and saying ""not so good?"" with no offer of a remedy.

Two stars because the fried rice was pretty good.",negative
ch225,5/20/2014,revch683,3,"This was my first visit to Sushi Roku. It was a nice setting and the decor is very pleasant. The service was just okay, nothing special. The food was good. We had a premium priced edamame beans that were pretty much the same as I have had everywhere including the frozen food section of my local store. The Ikura, Uni were both good, but again not over the top. The soft-shelled crab was very nice. We also had a couple of rolls that again were good, but not memorable. All in all it was a good dinner. Had a chance to catch-up with friends. The noise level was good so having a conversation was easy.",negative
ch225,5/5/2014,revch684,2,"Good.....not great. The food was tasty but I don't recommend doing a ""trust me"" menu with the waiter alone.....our waiter told us he would prepare one we could share and it was very lackluster (i'm taking about beyond basic...spice tuna roll, tuna sushi, pot-stickers) so that was disappointing. Nice ambiance, but for the prices, I would go somewhere more upscale and that takes more risks, like Nobu. Also it was a birthday and I told 4 people but they still forgot to bring my husband the desert and sparkler to the table.....I ended up having to remind them and they served it to him in the bar on the way out...pretty lame but better than nothing. Don't do a special dinner here is what I would recommend.",negative
ch225,5/2/2014,revch685,5,"This place was fantastic!!!   We were staying a Nobu, a boutique hotel in Caesar's.  We just arrived in Vegas and were looking for a nice place to sit, relax and enjoy a satisfying meal.

We happened upon Sushi Roku and decided to give it a try.  We had a window view of the strip.  Not only that but the food was fantastic as well as the service.  I'm a vegetarian and was there with two co-workers who were not.   The waiter was very helpuful at answering my questions about the dishes.  I ordered a couple of appetizers because that's about all there was that was veg. The waiter was great about letting me know that we could start out with just a couple of the small dishes (salad & an eggplant dish),   He said if they were not sufficient he'd put in an orer for an additional dish.  That really impressed me. Often when I order veggie dishes the waiters will act like they think I'll be starving.  Not here!!  And my meal was more than sufficient.  And oooooh, so good!! The Miso Eggplant appetizer was especially delish.  

I'm so glad we decided to take the chance and stop here.",positive
ch225,4/25/2014,revch686,3,"My boyfriend and I came here for dinner the other night on our trip to Vegas. We're from Southern California so we know good sushi and while this place was absolutely gorgeous inside, I was a little disappointed. I knew it was going to be pricey, but I thought maybe the portions would be a little bigger and the sushi would be more unique. We ordered the jalapeño tuna roll and the scallop roll. The food runner accidentally brought out a roll that we didn't order but he said we could just keep it, so that was a plus! It was good, don't get me wrong, but I've definitely had very similar sushi rolls at numerous restaurants in California. Our server was very nice and our food came out quickly. I would recommend this place for sure, I guess I'm just spoiled when it comes to the sushi places by my house :)",negative

We did a tasting type deal where they brought out many different dishes of sashimi, rolls and such, everything was fresh and nothing like I had ever had before. And I am one who did not eat much raw sushi before this trip. It is going to be very hard for me to eat sushi just from anywhere from now on and previously I was ok with eating Kroger sushi :) This will be a definite stop for me when I return to Vegas and a definate recommendation for those who are in the vicinity. I love this place!",positive

ch225,4/7/2014,revch693,4,"First night in Vegas and we were looking for something light to eat before hitting up the club.  Nobu was booked, so we decided to try Sushi Roku.  Reservations weren't hard to get and I had heard good things so it was a go.

We decided to order a bunch of appetizers and small plates to share for four guys.  One could't eat meat due to lent and I couldn't have carbs. Even with those restrictions we were successful in getting some tasty dishes.  

The Truffle Edamame was really tasteful, but you can't really go wrong when its sprinkled with truffle oil, yum!  Shishito peppers were okay, I've had better (at Nobu, haha).  

Yellowtail Diced Chilies were really fresh and tasty.  I good balance of flavors with a not too tangy sauce to compliment the delicate yellowtail flavore.

The highlight of the show was teh Chilean Seabass Truffle Miso Glaze!  Delicious.  I have never met a Miso Glaze I did not like, but add truffle to it, and I was in heaven.  Went perfect with the smooth like butter seabass (i kinda wish the black cod had the truffle miso glaze, but it was only described as Sweet Miso, so I passed).  

Other items we got were the Uni Tartlette (couldn't eat the pastry so just at the inside. Small, and flavor no so Uni-ish.  The sweet shrimp (Amaebi) was really fresh and the fried shrimp heads with it were the perfect compliment, Fresh and Fried.  

We also got rolls, but i didn't partake because of the rice.

All in all, Sushi Roku is pretty good.  Flavors really stood and were well balanced.  Service was excellent as to be expected.  Price was a bit on the high end for what it was but that's normal for Vegas.

I would come back (unless I have a reservation for Nobu).",positive

ch225,3/16/2014,revch697,4,Pleasantly surprised with the quality of sushi here. Everything is fresh as can be including some killer uni and monk fish liver. The black cod was also cooked just right. Good vibe and space with good views of the strip. If you're looking for top notch sushi this place has it covered just that it comes at a premium price. But it is Vegas and someone has to pay for all those lights.,positive
ch225,3/13/2014,revch698,3,"Went here for Happy Hour with my daughter.  We didn't have our car so when I Yelped sushi restaurants on the strip, not many came up. I felt that the price was right for happy hour, the service was mediocre, but the food items were hit and miss.  Some were amazing and others were just ""meh."" The California rolls were surprisingly bland. We had an amazing sashimi fish dish that was served with ponzu sauce and had some yummy, fried brown onions on top. It was so good we ordered another!  
Overall though, don't expect a lot from this place. Consistency throughout is what I look for in any restaurant and we were desperate for sushi so unfortunately I would say, we kind of settled.  We did feel satiated in the end because we got our sushi fix, but I won't ever go back again.",negative
ch225,3/13/2014,revch699,4,"My girlfriend and I had a last minute trip to Las Vegas on Valentine's Day and of course just about everything was booked! So we went on Open Table and found out Sushi Roku had late night reservations. We went for a nice stroll and went to our dinner. We were sat at an great table next to an exquisite view of the Las Vegas strip. It was very romantic, the crowd was very hip, and the attire was semi-casual. We ordered the truffle edamame (definite recommendation) and 3 rolls of sushi to split. Don't bother going to Kabuki or any second rate sushi place because the sushi here is delicious! The only thing I would complain about is the price but you pay for quality and you look like a stud waving the check to your date at the end of the night!",positive

This is the BEST sushi i have ever had in my entire life.  (Trust me- I am old and I have lived in Japan.)
I suggest you bring zip locks to line your coat so that you can bring home  black truffle tempura hand rolls in your purse. I don't know how food safe that would be but  it makes me smile just thinking about!
We had a fabulous meal with an incredible view and just being there in a beautifully designed place.    Very nice attention to detail.

One of the items on the lunch sushi special was a california roll, which without avocado is a simulated crab roll since they apparently don't have cucumber on them here?  Anyway, it was my birthday and we paid more than $40 for lunch here...I felt like I wasted my money though they did give me a cool sparkler and sing happy birthday with a cool dessert...that was the only thing that got them up to two stars.",negative

ch225,2/10/2014,revch714,5,Food was so amazing. What made the meal special was our waitress Danielle. She knew the menu inside and out and made wonderful recommendations.

Sushi is solid, but nothing your usual local Sushi bar won't offer for 12-15 a roll. Service is somewhat irritating- kept coming back too often and wouldn't let me have a decent conversation.

ch225,1/20/2014,revch717,3,"AG made reservations here (Saturday night, 6:30PM) for us to celebrate the end of YM's days as a single lady.  

AMBIANCE: Dim, sleek and sexy.  We were seated in a booth, which I think is the way to go (although the tables near the ceiling to wall glass windows with a view of the strip lights seemed nice too).  The noise level was low to start the night, but gradually got rowdy-- you could definitely tell that some of the tables were downing liquid courage.

SERVICE: Our waitress was super cute/friendly, but did mess up our drink order once.  The GM stopped by our table to say hello, but it didn't seem like we got any special treatment.

FOOD: Average.  I think there was either a set menu, or a previously decided upon order, since our food started arriving course by course as soon as our drink orders were taken.

- edamame: Sprinkled lightly with sea salt, I was disappointed the seasoning wasn't evenly distributed.  It also seemed strange that a seemingly nice place like Sushi Roku would charge for edamame (or include it as one of the charged for courses in a set menu).
- Hamachi carpaccio (1 slice of fish/person): Eh.  Also slightly disappointing.  The flavors were good (yuzu drizzle, etc), but the fish could've been fresher.  The girls really liked this dish though, so maybe its just me.
- Filet mignon wrapped asparagus (1 roll/person): Presentation was nice-- the rolls were stacked up on each other on top of a sizzling rock.  A soy glaze was poured on top before serving, and emitted an impressive amount of steam.  I ended up with a piece that was sitting on top of the rock-- the meat was fairly tough for a supposedly tender cut.  I'm also not a huge fan of asparagus, so this dish was meh for me.
- Crispy miso shrimp (several shrimps/person): My fave of the night, but it was essentially honey walnut prawns, minus the sweet mayo.
- Chicken & beef teriyaki skewers (1 of each skewer/person): The beef skewers featured nice tender chunks of beef.  The chicken wasn't as good as the beef imo, but at least they were juicy and not dry.
- Assortment of sushi (a couple pieces of sushi/person): Eh.  Par.
- Dessert trio: Cheesecake (thumbs down; it had a REALLY hard buttery crust), cinnamon sugar donut ""holes"" (good, very fluffy, came with caramel and vanilla dipping sauces), and a molten chocolate lava cake (very good, very lava-y).

The cocktails were hit or miss, but I really liked the bourbon one with cilantro and raspberries.

OVERALL: Solid 3 stars.  I actually have no idea how much the meal cost, so my rating may change after I see the bill.  Anything more than $40pp would be too much for what we ate.",negative
ch225,1/20/2014,revch718,5,"I love Sushi Roku.  I have never had something that I didn't enjoy here.

Just needed a quick bite before the Shania Twain show. This place fit the bill..
Both the calamari and chicken satay skewers tasted great.. Along with that enjoyed a nice tasting glass of nicely chilled white wine.. Sat at the bar and enjoyed friendly efficient service and the price was right.. Will definitely be back next time in Vegas",positive
ch225,1/16/2014,revch721,4,"I've been a big fan of the Sushi Roku in Pasadena for years! The Vegas one is a step down from the one in Pasadena, but it's still enjoyable if you're looking for reasonably priced sushi in Vegas. It's located inside a mall, so the location leaves something to be desired, but whatever.
We got an assortment of rolls and sashimi as well as some alcoholic beverages. The waitress forgot our sake so she ended up giving us an extra one for free! Really nice of her! 
SERVICE: Minus forgetting our sake, the service was really good.
FOOD: the rolls were really good but the some of the sashimi were cut unevenly. 
I've been to other sushi bars in Vegas, however, and they were all twice as expensive as this place, so I thought it was worth it. Also, they have allot of non sushi items on their menu too, so if you're going with sushi lovers and you hate it, there's plenty for you!",positive
ch225,1/14/2014,revch722,4,"Sushi Roku was a great experience. We were seated and served so quickly. We had an 8 o clock friday night dinner reservation and although they were quite busy, many members of the staff made sure to take care of us. Highly recommend the cocktails and the makoto roll, so yummy. They also brought out a huge sparkler and decorated plate of desert for my boyfriend, as we were celebrating hid birthday.",positive
ch225,1/13/2014,revch723,4,"The wait was a little long, but that's because I put in a special request for a booth. Since it was going to be longer, we request the first available. They created an adhoc table out in the front to accommodate which was unusual but great for last minute.  The food was excellent. Very tasty and even though the waitress said that kitchen was behind, came out in perfect tempo. The miso cod was exquisite, not new but cooked excellent. Loved the brussell sprouts and the sashimi was very fresh. Great evening spent.",positive

Service: 3 Stars

I give it a total of 3.5 but I always round down.

Thursday night we had reservations at 8:45 PM. Did not get seated until 9:10 PM so the reservations did not have much help. The ambience is nice, dimly light, bar near the front, big open space.

Food:
Sashimi - VERY fresh, this is probably the best thing on the menu. We ordered Salmon, Tuna, Yellowtail, etc. all very good.

Filet Mignon wrapped Asparagus - this was a nice treat, beef was tender, and well marinated.

Kobe Potstickers - nothing special, save your money. Don't get it.

All of their rolls were nothing special.

Chilean Seabass - This was very very good. I highly recommend this.

Overall the FOOD is good, just the service wasn't the best. This review is based on food + service. I recommend this restaurant if it was based on Food only.",negative
ch225,1/5/2014,revch725,4,"Another favorite of ours in Vegas didn't disappoint us on this trip. 

My wife is not a fan of fish but there is plenty on the menu for her to choose from. 

She chose a cucumber and avocado roll and had them use soy paper instead of seaweed.  And chicken teriyaki, rice, with vegetable tempura. 

I had an assortment of rolls and a friend joined us late but the restaurant accommodated without any problems.  

As others have said there may be better sushi restaurants on the strip but we live the view, food, and service and will be back on our next trip.",positive
ch225,1/4/2014,revch726,5,"Alright I am not lying when I say Sushi Roku has the and I will say it again the best filet mignon I have ever tasted!!!!....!!!!! (medium rare). I could take it apart with my fork and sight pressure from my knife.   We had popcorn shrimp too (big portion). I was so full when I left.  The atmosphere of the restaurant is dark  but sexy and has a great view of the strip (so ask for a window seat).  My girlfriend had the spicy tuna roll which was good. 

 The app menu is long so don't get confused like I did, but I was impressed with  popcorn shrimp, so no telling how large the other apps unless I hear it from you yelpers. But there was some stuff that sounded good.",positive
ch225,1/3/2014,revch727,2,"Quite disappointed with this place on NYE. The portions were soooo tiny, MY GOSH for $145, I'd expected more. The girl on the phone said 7 course, when we got there it's only 6 course. Not only that but seriously, everything is tiny! I been to Japan and even their portions were bigger. 

The sushi did not seem fresh at all. The color was quite dull. The tofu lobster thing was alright, and the dessert-- I definitely had better.

The worst part was the fact they kept forgetting about our order and wanted to rush us to finish. The couple next to us was even asked by the Manager to leave and move to the bar if they wanted to stay. 

I didn't even get my champagne toast because it took them so long, so I left. The view and the seating was disappointing, despite the fact I have already requested a good window seating.

The cocktail was good, ginger lychee mojito, but gah...I'm quite disappointed and would not come back. Maybe if I was coming back for the Anago since it's the only place I've seen so far that serves it. I should of ordered off the regular menu, but the girl mentioned the pre fixe was better..yea..right..",negative

ch225,12/28/2013,revch730,3,"Oh dear god can someone get me another black truffle tempura handroll STAT. That's all you need to get from here. $10 or so and you'll have this beautifully crunchy and nutty mouthful of sushi. The black truffle is in the dipping sauce they serve the roll with so don't be an idiot and go dipping in your regular soy sauce! I would only come back to Sushi Roku to order this handroll. 

Yes you do get a nice, undisturbed view of the strip (towards the Bellagio and Paris) but you'll definitely pay an arm and a leg for very small portions of sushi. Delicious, yes. Filling? Not so much. 

The lobster roll we got has a special sauce drizzled all over the plate that tastes a lot like Todai's creamy sauce baked over their lobster halves and boy was it fingerlicking good. But it was $21+ for 5 (kind of small) pieces of sushi (see my picture if you don't believe me). 

You are definitely paying for the view and atmosphere here. So go ahead, bring a date here if you want to splurge. But if you want a full stomach without breaking the bank, Sushi Roku ain't the place for you!

P.S. I'm all for ambiance and I understand that this is a sushi restaurant so the saying ""quality over quantity"" is taken very literally, but if a place is going to charge that much for their food, I expect service to be top notch as well and for me the service was just so-so. Hence, the 3 stars.",negative
ch225,12/27/2013,revch731,5,Food is good. Not bad for Las Vegas Resort Restaurant. You won't be disappointed. The music is not so good. The service was okay. The decor is okay. The food was the best,positive
ch225,12/24/2013,revch732,2,The restaurant itself is very beautiful and the service is excellent but the food leaves a lot to the imagination. My wife and I go to a great sushi restaurant every Wednesday in the city of Alameda CA and I ordered the same thing that I always order and am used to paying about $37.50. What I got at Roku was about 1/2 the quanity and about !/2 the quality. The Nigri pieces were cut very thin and the Chirashi pieces were also cut very thin and the quanity was very sparce. We received a bill without the tip for $97.40. What a rip off to say the least. I wasn't expecting it. I guess this restaurant is only for turists who probably never ate sushi or will never go back. I sure would not go back or recommend this place to anyone.,negative
ch225,12/23/2013,revch733,5,"Awesome venue.  Music and mood is really fun.  Nice dark lighting, but still bright enough.  The food is good, but be prepared to get multiple courses.  The portions were a little small but expected in a great ambience like this.",positive
ch225,12/20/2013,revch734,3,"As a sushi lover, I had high expectation for sushi roku, but after my dinner experience here I really think this restaurant is totally overrated. We had blue fin o toro and makuro, the fish was pretty fresh, however not surprisingly good. Despite the size of sushi being too small, the major problem this restaurant had was that the sushi rice was not good. The portion of rice and sticky rice was off, so the sushi rice was not tiny sour-ish nor sticky enough. The decoration of the restaurant was really nice but I don't think I will visit again.",negative

Since we weren't terribly hungry, we only ordered a few rolls/nigiri ($7-22 or market price): black truffle tempura handroll, salmon, albacore uni and tuna. We also ordered from the specials menu ($6-90). With a glass of Riesling in hand, we got...

Yellowtail-wrapped Foie Gras with Truffle Soy:
My eyes automatically scope out ""foie gras"" and ""truffle"" and send a signal to my taste buds that I'm about to have something amazing in my mouth. So amazing that my hands did not get a signal to take pictures. You'll just have to try it to know how beautiful this is. 5/5

Robata Style Japanese Wagyu Beef with Hawaiian Pink Salt:
You get a nice presentation of your skewer on its own robata grill and a spoon with pink rock salt. The wagyu is tender and fatty - feels nice on the tongue. The pink salt accentuates the flavor of the wagyu. 5/5

Scallop and Foie Gras Togarashi with Black Pepper and White Truffle Oil:
It's like a re-run of the first dish I had except this time, I got distracted by the black pepper taste. The scallops were perfectly cooked. 4/5

Blue Fin Tuna Sushi:
The fish was at the right temperature. The texture of the rice was just right. The fish to rice ratio was perfect. 5/5

Black Truffle Tempura Handroll:
This is wrapped in a thin soy paper. There's avocado inside. The truffle flavor is in the sauce. 4/5

-Panko Double Shrimp Roll - My favorite!  So good!

The view of the strip is pretty amazing. Our server was very nice and didn't mind waiting for the rest of our party to show up.

The sushi and cocktails are top notch - we tried the black truffle hand roll which was very flavorful and unique.   I recommend the shishito appetizer (Japanese peppers) - excellent preparation.  We also had seaweed salad, makoto roll and a roll from the specials - everything was super fresh and incredible.  We indulged in lychee martinis and even splurged on dessert.  And after an incredible meal, you get to walk it off afterwards by shopping in the Caesar's Forum - a perfect end. I love to take visiting company here, it's a great Vegas experience.  I will be back soon!!",positive
ch225,10/22/2013,revch753,4,"We came on a Sunday night, and I think that was the perfect night to go. Originally, I had made reservations on opentable but had to cancel due to changing plans. I ended up going anyway, and we were seated right away. However, the waitress told us that the night before was insane and completely packed. She was really friendly :)

We ordered:
2 Eastern Mules (I think that's what it was called... deeelicious)
Kobe Gyoza (yum!)
Deep fried sea bass (om nom nom)
filet mignon (i cannot attest to this plate but I can say that my spouse licked the plate clean)

Drinks were on point, gyoza yummy, and fish soooooooo good!!

Rolls sounded pretty yummy too.. I was happy with my choice to come here!",positive
ch225,10/22/2013,revch754,4,"Went here for a birthday. The food was good and the service was good, I would go definitely go bavk again (especially since I found out they have a happy hour)",positive
ch225,10/19/2013,revch755,4,"Having been a frequent visitor to the establishments in LA when I was living down there, I have always had a soft spot for Sushi Roku.  Having been to Sushi Roku a few times in Vegas, this is my first time actually reviewing it!  My fiance and I had dinner here on a Friday night while in town, and Sushi Roku definitely did not disappoint. After getting seated at a table with a beautiful view of the strip, we decided to go with the following:

Drinks:
Me: Pear Blossom
Him: Salary Man
Share: Recommended sake from our waiter

-Tuna Carpaccio: I've said this a number of times (including in my review of Sushi Roku in Santa Monica), this is and has been one of THE best things I've had...ever.  The sesame soy dressing and garlic chips that comes with this makes it absolutely amazing.  As I've said before, if licking the plate was socially acceptable, I would do it, especially for this.  An absolute must-have item.

-Chicken Karaage: Delicious, hot, and crispy, this dish definitely did not disappoint. The delicious wasabi cream that came with this was definitely helpful for this.

-Chutoro sashimi: It's been a really long time since both of us have had quality pieces of fish, and this certainly was worth every bite.  The fish quality was so great, we decided to follow on with another few pieces of Otoro later on.  Definitely nailed both of these sashimi dishes, but the Chutoro was definitely the winner.

-A^2 Fusion Roll: One of the night's specialty rolls with albacore, avocado, and cucumber, I think?  Either way, it wasn't great, and was one of the more disappointing dishes we had that night.  Didn't stop me from eating all of it, but Greg didn't want any part of it.

-Gyoza: Delicious dumplings stuffed with Kobe beef! So amazing! I don't think I've ever had anything like this.  After the tuna carpaccio, this was Greg's second favorite dish.

-Raspberry Bread Pudding: AMAZEBALLS. The dish came with chocolate ice cream on top, and a cream, caramel, and raspberry sauce at the bottom.  With my cappuccino, this was absolutely amazing.  It was definitely a fantastic way to end our meal.

Sushi Roku was definitely everything I remembered and more!  We definitely had a great experience here, and will be coming back for that Tuna Carpaccio!",positive
ch225,10/16/2013,revch756,5,"Organized a dinner for 13 of us here. The private room, the attentive service from Miko and the amazing food selection, made for a great night. The atmosphere and view sent the night over the top. The robata skewers of sea bass and Kobe beef were enjoyed by all. The roasted peppers and tempura shrimp were a hit as well. The sliced tuna was amazing and converted two more to sushi.",positive
ch225,10/3/2013,revch757,5,"In las Vegas as well as other big restaurant/entertainment towns, good food is expected but in Las Vegas it sometimes does not fully compare to Chicago and NY.

However, the one place I finally went to was Samba Sushi and what a great surprise.  I tend to avoid sushi in several places when traveling unless in Hawaii and some parts of CA and Japan.  Sushi Samba had some of the best dishes I have had and the quality was great.  They have a variety of menu items with small plates and full entrees.  They do some traditional sushi but mostly more interesting variations as well as the S American dishes.  Some of the items were:
Rock fish
Wagyu Gyoza
Rock shrimp tempura
Green bean tempura
Pork belly
Moqueca Mista. Seafood coconut milk and rice with green onion
Yamato sushi roll(maguro, Fois gras, Osetra caviar)
Uni shushi outstanding 
Great sake list

All the fish and shellfish were fresh and well prepared.

It gets busy so we ate at the bar and the service was excellent there.  Luna and Maria can help with picking some great dishes at the bar.

It is on the higher price side but worth it compared to a lot of other places where the food doesn't always live up to the expectations in Vegas.  Looking forward to next trip back there.",positive
ch225,10/1/2013,revch758,4,"Sushi Roku is inside Caesar's Palace on the third floor of the Forum Shops. The inside is a mix of modern and Asian design. It looks sleek and posh. 

The food is a little pricey, but it is understandable since it's on the Strip. The view from the dining area is really nice. I ordered the spicy tuna roll because I am a huge fan of spicy tuna. It did not disappoint. The tuna was very fresh and it was obviously much better quality than other sushi places. 

This is a good place to go for dinner before a night out. Nice and classy.",positive
ch225,9/28/2013,revch759,3,"While visiting Las Vegas, we popped in here for a quick lunch.  As typical for Vegas, everything was overpriced, but we'll let that slide.  We had a really tasty rock shrimp tempura roll with jalapeños.  It had a nice crunch and spice; we would definitely order that again.  The noodle dish we ordered was entirely forgettable though (so forgettable that I honestly don't even remember what it was!).  The service was courteous, but not engaging in any way.  Definitely okay for a quick bite, but not a place that is on my list to return to.",negative
ch225,9/21/2013,revch760,5,"My husband and I really enjoyed the generous happy hour here. Out favorites were the spicy yellow tail, the filet mignon wrapped asparagus and the albacore sashimi with garlic aioli. The bar staff was fun and friendly. We will return!",positive
ch225,9/16/2013,revch761,4,"My friend and I had time to kill before she had to go in to work. We stopped by Sushi Roku since it was close to our work. On Fridays, their happy hour ends earlier than the rest of the week. Monday through Thursday, it goes until 7pm. On Friday, it ends at 6pm.

Since we missed the happy hour by a few minutes, we still decided to grab a bite at the bar. The mushroom tempura is, by far, the best item on the menu. Light batter, fried crispy, and tossed in truffle aioli makes for the perfect snack. The miso black cod is also very delicious. The fish flakes into beautiful slivers. The octopus carpaccio is not as tender as I would hope. It pales in comparison to the first two dishes.

Now I need to sneak away at a decent time to attend their happy hour.",positive
ch225,9/8/2013,revch762,3,"Ok, but not that great.  Very nice atmosphere, but sushi was just ok.  I really wanted Shibuya at MGM, but for some reason they were closed all week.",negative

ch225,8/24/2013,revch766,5,Amazing! Amazing! Amazing! By far one of my favorite places to eat in Vegas.  Never disappoints and the Prime Rib Eye Steak is a real delight.  I would recommend this place to anyone.  Try the infused Saki!   The server was very knowledgeable and an asset to the restaurant.,positive
ch225,8/19/2013,revch767,4,"Love this place and if you get great seating, you have the view to the whole strip. The food here is great! I've asked for certain rolls that I have eaten at their SoCal location, and they were happy to make for me. Servers are attentive and the sushi chefs are all entertaining and friendly. Quality is always above and beyond, no complaints!",positive

ch225,8/12/2013,revch769,3,"Short Story:
Vegas has some good sushi?!  I'm surprised...

Long Story:
I came here for lunch on Thursday, and it was not crowded.  We were promptly seated and we ordered the Karaage appetizer, the Teriyaki salmon, and the beef Teriyaki.  All the dishes were good and they came with sashimi.  I got to say, the sashimi was good, though I didn't have high expectations as this was Vegas...and not hear the coast.  It did take a bit of time to get our food, but it was forgivable.  

Verdict:
I would go back if and when I go back to Vegas.  Though I'm sure there are other good places to go too.",negative
ch225,8/12/2013,revch770,1,"Came in here about five o clock. A friend of mines made a reservations because I've read reviews saying this place is awesome and crowded.... It was a ghost town. I thought they said happy hour on Sundays? I guess not. The sushi was ok. My rainbow roll wasn't really a rainbow roll. It had waaaaaaaaaay too much avocado on top and no fish?! Literally 5 rolls were avocado and 3 actually had fog on top, with a little bit of avocado. 

Our server sucked big time. We were done with our food and he didn't  come to give us our bill. IT WASN'T EVEN BUSY. My friend was drunk and impatient. So I told her we will meet her outside. It took a while. YIKES.

I was pretty excited to go here because I live in California and wanted sushi so bad. I didnt know vegas much. It was a whatever experience here. Née going back. Both my friend and girlfriend made fun of me because I was super excited for this ""awesome"" place..... Fail!!",negative
ch225,8/12/2013,revch771,5,"Delicious sushi and cocktails. A bit pricy but worth it. Bartender and manager were very nice and made me feel welcomed and special. Come for happy hour for cheeper sushi rolls and drinks. Happy hour starts earlier on the weekends   They have happy hour everyday of the week. They are always happy to also customize a sushi roll to your taste or make you something not listed on the menu. Will be back again soon for sure. Make sure you try the pineapple brown sugar cocktail...so delicious!

Enter the forum shops across the street from Harrah's, that way you are not walking miles through the mall looking for the place.",positive
ch225,8/2/2013,revch772,4,"Do not under any circumstances try and get to this place by going through Caesers....you will go hungry :-(   We made that mistake and 40 minutes later, on foot, we finally found it.     At this point, it was worth it because we were frustrated, needed a drink and were super hungry after the unexpected workout.   That being said, they must get that often because they held our reservation or they just weren't that busy.   I'm guessing it's the latter.  In it's hey day, it was probably the talk of the town and it's still a nice restaurant with just a touch of over ambiance but they do offer gorgeous views of the strip.    The food was great  and priced really well if you need a sushi fix.   Our waitress was super nice and on top of the service.   We let her know that we were short on time and had to make a show.   She was attentive but not pushy and made sure we got our food timely.   Ask for recommendations on food because there are a number of special rolls that are available and not on the menu.   The Lotus roll in particular was very good.

There is seating by the windows and booths along the wall.   Ask for the booth because it is more comfortable and also a raised section, that's where the best view of the strip can be found.",positive
ch225,7/26/2013,revch773,4,"7/25: Located in Forum Shops at Caesars Palace casino. I looked up a site that lists sushi restaurants with Happy Hour available. This place was one of them and had a good rating as well, so I decided to give it a try. The food was pretty good, and most of the service was great. 

It was pretty quiet a little before 6PM on a Thursday, and I walked up to the front without a reservation. My friendly hostess promptly and politely sat me down in the bar dining area, although I requested to sit at the bar. Not sure if she misunderstood me or not. (FYI: it was pretty hot in that area; I'm not sure if the A/C was on...the bar was just right). A Happy Hour menu requested, which wasn't available in that area, so one of the waitstaff courteously moved my beverages to the bar. 

My bartender/waitress Lauren was awesome! She works pretty fast; there was an instance or two when I felt rushed, but that's better than slow service. She was very friendly and social, and we introduced each other as well. The rest of the staff was meh. Food was served in a reasonable amount of time, and the presentation was pretty cool. 

TIP: I was told that locals get 20% off regular menu prices! (double check on that before you go)

-Kobe Meatballs ($6)
-Fried Calamari ($4) 
-Spicy Yellowtail Roll ($5 cut)
-A2 Fusion Roll (albacore, onion, avocado & jalapeno...$5) 
-Eel & Avocado Roll ($5)...I'm a fan of unagi and this was fresh and delicious! 
-Mini Tropical Fruit Cheesecake ($3)...one of the best, if not the best, desserts I've ever had! They don't give you a huge slice, which can be a good thing. It's pretty sweet and rich, tastes like coconut with oreo crust. SO good! 
-Iced Tea was ""only"" $3.50 as well (I think it's usually $4+ on the Strip). Lauren even offered a full cup to go, which I accepted of course.

All of the food was great, although I wasn't expecting a couple of items to come in such small proportions (meatballs and calamari). Happy Hour might actually be more profitable in terms of cost/profit margin and bringing in customers; not just here, but at most places. 

Overall a pretty good experience. I have no doubt that I would be satisfied with the quality of the other appetizers. I'd come back again for ""Red Sun"" Happy Hour!",positive
ch225,7/25/2013,revch774,4,"I was recommended to try Sushi Roku located in the Forum Shops and I'm glad I did.  
The restaurant itself is nicely decorated.  I liked the decor that's on the restrooms doors.
(See photo) 

Service: 
From the time I walked in to leaving the restaurant I felt like I was special. 
I was warmly greeted by a young lady in which I mentioned that I would be dining alone and would like a view of the strip.  DONE! She sat me right along the windows that overlooked the south side of the strip.  
Hugo, my server, was very helpful in recommending a sushi of my liking. He kept coming around to make sure that I liked my dish and we got to chit chat a little about the food.   (I don't eat raw fish often but in this case I figure I'd try it and see if it was fresh)

I'm glad I did. My sushi was topped with Tuna that was yummy and fresh. I also informed him that I don't like too much jalapeno's  so he made sure it was on the side rather than wrapped in my sushi.  The miso soup was tasty and very flavorful and I washed it down with a Blue Moon.  ( I know I should've had a Sapporo instead) 

My experience here was amazing that whenever I'm in Vegas I will definitely return.",positive

We told her we were open to her suggestions, just asked that she keep in mind my sesame allergy...she was spot on with everything, such great recommendations, everything was delicious! We enjoyed the Yellowtail Sashimi with Diced Chililes, Edamame (great flavor whatever they do), Katana Roll, White Lotus Roll (a bit of a kick, so good) and for dessert Uni. Everything was so tasty I would have it all again right now!!! We also enjoyed a carafe of the Sawanoi cold sake which was perfect for us! We highly recommend this place & Debra!

ch225,7/17/2013,revch776,3,"The flavors were great in the rolls we ordered, and it was very clear the quality of the fish was high and fresh.  However I wish especially in the specialty rolls that there was a better balance and variety in texture. When a roll is specially designed like that it is always nice for me to have an element of crispness or crunch that was not present in the majority of the sushi we ordered.  We had two of the gin specialty drinks in the menu and they were extremely refreshing!  Lovely, aromatic mixtures though the cucumber garnish was not in great condition.  Ambiance was nice -- competition with Tao it would seem.     Our server as well was sweet though it seemed he was a but overwhelmed... It took him a while to get our last roll to us, and he double checked with us on the order at least 5 mins after he should have already punched it in.  Overall,  I might not dine here again because it was extremely expensive, and I'd rather explore other Vegas options.",negative

ch225,7/12/2013,revch778,5,"Sushi Roku is hands down my favorite sushi restaurants from all around the country. I have been to multiple sushi places in Vegas and all over the east coast. As a super sushi lover, it is extremely rare that I am impressed with the quality of sushi the way I was with Sushi Roku. Growing up my parents owned their own sushi restaurant and I am confident when I say.. I know my fish. I don't know or understand how they manage to always have the freshest quality of fish despite the fact that LV is in the middle of a desert but I hope they keep it up.. forever. 

Servers are helpful, kind, and knowledgeable of the menu. If you don't know where to start, ask them for their thoughts and they'd definitely help you. I highly recommend the Shima Roll but to be really honest, it seems that you can't go wrong with anything on the menu. The price range tends to be on the higher end but hey, you're in vegas--the city of excess/riches and you're in a desert yet you are being served fresh fish.. what did you expect? And as I've said, the quality and taste is as good as it gets. 

If you are a sushi lover, I recommend that you give this place a go!",positive
ch225,6/22/2013,revch779,4,"This was a fantastic meal in an excellent setting.  There was a group of 6 of us eating, so we had several dishes.  The service was excellent, as we never had to wait long for new items once the food started rolling in.  Although we had primarily sushi, the star of the dish for me was the wagyu beef.  For $60, you get 6 strips of melt in your mouth steak that you cook at your table on a hot rock.  Just a dip in a soy sauce based sauce, a few seconds on the hot pot, and you are set.  The mouth feel was ""melt in your mouth,"" the fat breaking down and the steak seemed to melt as you chewed it.  The flavor was off the charts, all agreed.  It was a great way to get a couple of bites of such an excellent piece of beef and not totally break the bank.

As I stated, we had many dishes, the standouts were the yellowtail sashimi, the crab dynamite, and a tempura shrimp roll that was a special, but I can't recall its name.  This one had a lot of spice to it, and the tempura was fantastic.  Not greasy in the slightest.  The makato roll was such a favorite we ordered another.  We tried the baked lobster roll which for me was decent, but not nearly as good as the other items we ordered.

The wife had the sauteed spicy shrimp.  They make this dish out to be spicier than it really is.  It has a nice sauce on top that has a little sweetness.  The real star of this dish was the housemade potato chips.  They went very well with the creamy sauce.

Very solid drink menu with a lot of Asian beers, which is typically my preferred drink at sushi places.  The view, as many have noted, is great of the strip.  But, if you don't want to watch cars or random people walking, you can certainly sit in areas of the restaurant that don't have the view.

Will definitely return, and highly recommended.",positive
ch225,6/16/2013,revch780,4,"I ordered unfiltered sake, seaweed salad, toro, albacore tuna, japanese snapper, yellowtail, salmon. Huge pieces of sashimi. I should've ordered the specialty rolls but I stuck with simple stuff. I wasn't that impressed BUT the service  was phenomenal. The waiters soooo attentive. They even packed my leftover sushi on top of ice and gave a to go cup for my left over sake. They were knowledgeable and let me taste two different sakes. I sat at the sushi bar and the chefs were friendly. The main dining area looks over the strip. It's also on the top floor of where the stores are.",positive
ch225,6/13/2013,revch781,5,"This place is a typical example of Vegas extravagance on the Strip. I opted for the Kobe ""American"" New York steak cut which is priced at over $50. Not sure how many ounces it ended up being but for not being the Japanese version, it was a very tender New York cut. Full of flavor, well seasoned, and a healthy side of varied mushrooms and green beans. You'll have to get your carbs from their various specialty sushi rolls or nigiri options.

Basic dessert menu, actually decided to skip it since it didn't stand out and the pricey entrée already made the dinner worthwhile.

Great ambiance and if you have the option, opt for the lounge seating instead of the normal tables.

5 stars for the awesomely flavored food and comfortable interior. Of course I could nit pick about the lackluster dessert options or opine about the lack of real Japanese Kobe beef, but the sushi, entrée, and appetizer menu is varied enough to include something for everyone.",positive

ch225,5/12/2013,revch785,5,"I come here every time I'm in Las Vegas and have done so for years. There is one close to me in Los Angeles, but I truly believe the Vegas location is the best of them all.  Yes, it is expensive, but the fish is flown in daily and it is consistently the best tasting fish available.  

Do yourself a favor and order the Shima Roll with spicy tuna, shrimp, cilantro and sriracha.  It is fantastic. Other Must-Try menu items are the garlic green beans, tuna carpaccio with garlic chips, the baked miso black cod, yellowtail sashimi with diced chilis, anything from their sushi/sashimi menu and their specials are always great. Whenever foie gras is on the specials menu, my partner always orders it because he can't get it in California and he always enjoys what he orders.

Been here several times and this last time we were a party of 7 in to celebrate a friend's birthday and from start to finish the service was excellent & attentive. Great view of the strip from where our table was located. The food & drinks though are what keep me coming back. The menu changes so even for us regulars there's always something new to be tied. I had the edamame hummus (only because I love both edamame & hummus & was curious about it) & crispy rice asparagus appetizers.  Next was the Kurobuta Pork ""Kakuni"" (braised pork belly) & my main was the Filet Mignon with Ginger Teriyaki sauce.  The hummus was great though they should serve it with a few more wonton chips than they do as those ran out long before the hummus did.  They did however bring out a few more chips when asked.  The crispy rice asparagus was  prepared and served as you would expect, and while it was good, it wasn't as memorable as other dishes the table ordered. The Kakuni on the other hand was my favorite dish of the night (and that's also including all the dishes of my dining companions that I also tried). All you pork belly fans, this is one of the best preparations I've ever had of this fatty delectable treat. The Filet was served sliced alongside mashed potatoes & garlic green beans...the Filet was perfectly cooked and seasoned perfectly! A phenomenal dinner was had by all!

ch225,3/19/2013,revch796,5,"Sushi Roku will always have a special place in the heart of my wallet. I was in vegas for a bachelor party. Initially my group of 16 was going to eat at Texas de Brazil, but after a couple days of buffets and steaks the guys in my group couldn't handle it anymore. We made last minute reservations at Sushi Roku for a party of 16 on a saturday.

I arrived a bit later but when I did some of the guys were getting hooked up big time at the bar with shots and drinks which was real cool. We were seated after taking some shots and just started ordering an assortment of sushi rolls and king crab fried rice. The king crab fried rice was simple yet so pleasing. It really hit the spot and filled us up quickly. Sushi rolls were all pretty decent. Of course we all partaked in sake bombs. 

The service was off the charts. The waitresses were so accommodating and polite. Upon getting our check they said we could take $400 dollars off. This was absolutely mind blowing. Apparently one of the guys of our party was chopping it up with the General manager unknowingly and complimented the dude on his $1600 dollar armani suit. BAM instant savings son. We all suspect he performed sexual favors to get us the discount. You do what you got to do when you are a team player I guess. I kid I kid.

Anyway the meal was decent, the service was ridiculously good, the restaurant decor was swanky and chill, and the bill for us, vegas standard wise, was an all time winner.

General Manager Johnny. Compliment the guy on his suit *cough*. The dude is an all time legendary great.",positive
ch225,3/11/2013,revch797,3,"Had a business dinner here and it was really good! I had shushito peppers, which were tasty and flavorful. Then the amberjack sushi (2 pieces) and an eel roll. That was enough food for me and I typically get 3-4 rolls at other sushi places. I really enjoyed this.",negative
ch225,3/6/2013,revch798,5,"I normally would give this type of restaurant 4 stars, but because of the fact that it's in Vegas and it was a Valentine's dinner, I will go all out and give it 5 stars! 

I had Sushi Roku as one of my bookmarks, and as I was sitting around waiting for my boyfriend, I realized that we didn't have reservations anywhere on Valentine's night. We had a show that night at the Caesars hotel, so I figured this would be perfect! I called and they took us in no problem. She did ask for my credit card to hold my reservation, but the machine was broken at the time. I wonder if they charge you if you don't show up..?

Anyway, it took us awhile to find this restaurant and I am pretty sure we went around and found every place you can eat at before we got to Sushi Roku. So for any future diners, the best thing to do just go through the Forum shops since it's located there, rather than the actual hotel. The atmosphere and decor is absolutely beautiful, from the lighting fixtures to the bathroom doors. We were sat at a table that had the view of the entire strip on one side and the other side looked out to Harrah's.. sooo cool! This is worth a visit just for the view alone!

The service was great but the food was even better... 

For the appetizer we got the Tuna Sashimi Carpaccio - I have never had anything like it before. It was delicious and so fresh that the tuna pieces just melt in your mouth. For our entrees, we split a few rolls:

-Makoto Roll - It's a spicy Yellow tail & Shrimp wrapped with seared tuna in a creamy spicy sauce. It's probably one of the best rolls I've ever tried in my life.

-Rainbow roll, Crunchy Spicy Tuna, and one more that I don't remember. Every roll was unbelievably fresh and done to perfection. 

For dessert, we both had cappuccino's and split a dessert - Raspberry bread pudding with Carmel... OH MY! 

This was definitely the best meal of the trip and a perfect place for a date!",positive
ch225,3/4/2013,revch799,4,"Service and ambiance are top notch. Sit at the sushi bar if possible for a great time interacting with the chefs.

ch340,1/5/2015,revch804,4,What a wondeful place to have a lunch.  The soup was excellent and service right on.  I have been back again and again and wish they would open in my Ahwatukee neighborhood.  The owner took the time to stop by the table and talk to us.  Could not ask for better food.,positive
ch340,1/3/2015,revch805,4,"I was so looking forward to a hot bowl of Pho that was truly authentic. I had seen this restaurant many times as it is located in the Mekong Shopping Plaza where I purchase authentic Chinese, Japanese and Indian ingredients. The Pho was disappointing! The only taste in the broth was 5 spice seasoning, the noodles were abundant but there was literally nothing else in this bowl! Where were the greens (yes they gave me a branch of mint to add myself along with brownish sprouts and way too hot slices of pepper) but there were no mushrooms, no snap peas or beans, no seaweed or anything else that would make this a pretty and tasty dish. Since this is their signature dish, I have to give this place a thumbs down! The service was good, but not enough to redeem this place.",positive
ch340,1/3/2015,revch806,4,"Originally I was not sure about coming here since I thought the name of the restaurant was gimmicky but this has to be one of the best places in the Phoenix area to get some Pho. I was pleasantly surprised about the quality of the noodle soups here. It seemed quite busy in there during my visit and the service did feel a bit rushed, but it doesn't bother me much as I was there just for a quick meal and I know how busy they can get at a restaurant like that. I plan to come back here to try out some of their other offerings!",positive
ch340,12/29/2014,revch807,5,"What the Phò!? 

I am sort of blown away here. I mean, I live in San Francisco. We neighbor San Jose which has a huge Vietnamese population.  And, this is top three Phò I've ever had. And, the Bun...best I've ever had.  

I'm at a loss...and,I'm now really jealous that this place is not down the street from where I live. I grew up in Tempe. So, when I'm here visiting I'll definitely return.  

The chicken in the Phò was delicious and tender, the egg noodles were fantastic and the broth was to die for.  As mentioned, the Bun was terrific too. Fresh herbs, great little fried egg roll, etc. 

The owner explained that they cook the broth for 26 hours. Flavor flave style.  Wait, can Flaver Flave actually cook? No one knows! And I don't want to find out. Just get your face into some of their fine soups and other delicious Vietnamese creations.",positive

ch340,12/24/2014,revch809,4,"This place is pretty good and a solid four stars but ultimately phogettable. The broth was very good but the meat itself was mediocre, chewy and low quality - certainly not what I expect from a nine dollar bowl. The portion size was good and the veggies and sauces were fine but the so so meat really keeps me from wanting to go back. Which is too bad because the broth was so good.

I also had their spring rolls which were awesome. Service was quick and good.",positive
ch340,12/19/2014,revch810,4,This is a very clean joint with good service.  The portions aren't huge but the owners care about how their food is prepared and presented.  I totally recommend this place.,positive

ch340,11/19/2014,revch812,5,Really enjoyed the Pho and spring rolls. Servers leave a little to be desired. Not much personality. If you care about the food more than the people come here cause it was good.,positive
ch340,11/16/2014,revch813,4,Another decent Pho place in the greater Phoenix area. This one is very clean and nicely decorated.  Staff is very friendly.  Pho and spring rolls are delicious. Price is a little more expensive compared to other pho places. But you do get a lot of food here.,positive
ch340,11/15/2014,revch814,3,"So the food here is ok, service is average, but I never expect good service at a Pho place, and they are slight higher than average.  The price for dishes here are about $1-$2 higher than I'm use too.  Bun are good.  Pho was good though I like the soup to come out piping hot, and it never is.  It's hot, just not steaming hot like I'm use too.

Decor is nice and clean, servers are generally friendly.  Where this place fails is in the nickel and diming.  They charge extra for getting your steak rare on the side instead of being in the soup.  There's also extra charge for take out so I've stopped getting that here also.  Worse yet, they charge extra for extra fish sauce.... that's like a hamburger place charging extra for ketchup.

I could understand some of these charges if the prices of the dishes weren't also above average.  On general principal though, charging a premium for the dishes and than charging extra for little things that should be free means this place is a once or twice a year place instead of once or twice a week for me.",negative
ch340,11/13/2014,revch815,4,"This place is great.  The service is extremely fast and very professional.  I love their  ice coffee with the condensed milk as I get it every time I go.  Also, their Pho and spring rolls are awesome!",positive

ch340,11/1/2014,revch817,5,"Staff is very busy running around, tending to the needs of customers coming and going. The spring rolls were very fresh and were served with a delicious peanut sauce. I have had numerous peanut sauces and they are usually colorless and tasteless which was not the case here.

My Pho was delivered to my table quickly and it was piping hot. A nice portion of fresh basil, bean sprouts, jalapeno slices and a wedge of lime was served on the side so that I could add to my liking.

Excellent bowl of goodness! 

The place was very clean and the staff could not have been more attentive or courteous.

The menu was huge for a restaurant of this type.

Well done!",positive
ch340,10/25/2014,revch818,4,"My Vietnamese friend and I first tried the specialty Ban Mam fish based soup. The broth was salty but tasty.  Nice pieces of white fish and a few thinly sliced meat topped the noodles.  My  companion said the traditional piece of squid was missing though. Next The Tom Bun arrived.  Grilled shrimp accompanied by freshly shredded greens topped this dry noodle dish.  With the side of julienned pork we ordered, this entree was great!  In fact the pork with its special sauce would have been great on anything!   Even though the staff made the mistake of bringing us the wrong dish the first time, they were apologetic and friendly.  Clean tables, clean dishware were impressive.  The last Vietnamese spot I dined at did not present its self well in the sanitation department.  :)  We had a good experience yesterday and UnPhogettable is on my ""will visit again list!""",positive

We come into the restaurant and it is actually a lot larger inside than it looks from the outside. Everybody inside was really nice and inviting. People who were coming in for lunch were greeted with recognition which was pretty nice knowing that people were coming back.

We started with egg roll appetizers and we have never had egg rolls with lettuce wraps. They were amazingly good! Our pho had came to our table and the smell was amazing. I ended up adding the jalepeno and the hotness of the broth had released the chili aroma and was just enough spice. The only complaint about the pho was how the chicken had tasted. The chicken had look and tasted like it came from a package. I'm not too sure why it had an odd taste but it did not set to well with me.

I would definitely come back to this location for some pho. Another reason I would come back is for the surrounding asian market.",positive

I ate here when my family and friends came into town for my graduation, and my friend's going away party was held at UnPhogettable. My parents talk about how good the pho was the last time they visited, and my boyfriend thinks their veggie pho is better than anywhere else.  I love that the same waitress that served me 5 years ago is still happy to see me when I come to dine, and I always enjoy the casual conversations I have with the owners each time I visit.  I think I feel like a part of the family when I enter this place, and perhaps that's why this restaurant is unforgettable in my opinion.

My favorite is #21 (seafood pho), but I have had most of the things on the menu by stealing some bites from my friends here and there.  The veggie pho (#23) is refreshing and has a clean after taste.  The rare steak and brisket (#9) seems to be a good choice for a person who has never tasted pho before.  There are plenty of other items on the menu starting from vermicelli bowls and grilled meats.  I think if you want to try some Vietnamese food that is consistently good, UnPhogettable would be a great place for you.",positive

The broth was very flavorful but the lack of seafood was disappointing. The main reason why I am giving this place one star is because the owner takes the tips from the servers. I read a review on Yelp with this information, and confirmed it with the server when we arrived. There are also two cameras in the restaurant, I assume to ensure that the very nice and efficient girl who helped us wouldn't be slipped anything without the owner's knowledge. This kind of practice is pathetic and unacceptable to me. Tips are for servers who work hard, not for the owner to steal. I did not leave a tip and will not return, as I will not support this unethical business practice. Please consider this if you choose to visit Unphogettable.",negative

The soup had machine-sliced chicken breast which was tender and lean.  Noodles were thin and sparse. Once again, while they added some cilantro, I like my own sprigs so I can go CRAZY with the greenery. The place is clean, inside Maekong Market, so you have to deal with the lookers and the noise/parking issues. I think if I had to order out my last pho meal, I would go with Da Vang, Pho Thahn, or even Nam Sau in Glendale. It wasn't perfect, but it was un-pho-gettable. Worth going for the name, really.

We tried Goi Cuon for appetizer.  It was ok, but the sauce was missing some flavors.  We ordered Pho with brisket, flank & lean steak and pork chop rice plate for main course.  The beef broth lacked the rich beef, herbs and veggie flavor, and the most disappointing, the grilled pork chop was drowing in a hoison sauce accompanied with steam rice rather than broken rice.  The menu clearly stated steam rice, but I should have stuck to my instinct that this restaurant lacked the authenticity.  When I asked the server for the nuoc cham dipping sauce, I had to explain the ingredients before they understood my request.

If money's tight, there are several cheaper options in the area that are still very good.  My only complaint (again) is the price.

ch340,6/8/2014,revch848,5,"Hands down my favorite place for Vietnamese food~

Owned by a lovely family, the service here is very friendly and very personal.  Through the owner's lovely wife, I learned how to drink Vietnamese coffee properly!  You may think that's a ridiculous thing to say but it was very motherly, sweet, and completely unnecessarily.  It's the fact that she took the time out to come over and teach me all the finer details of Vietnamese coffee that made the lesson and experience memorable.  Not even my Vietnamese friends had taken the time out to teach me!  Now the food here is truly unforgettable.  I love the bun by far!  It's crisp, fresh, and always leaves me full but not uncomfortably so.  I love their egg rolls and their spring rolls and the rice dishes are always savory and flavorful.  

I must admit though there is probably only *one* other place I'd rather go to get pho over this place [because they're cheaper, just as delicious, and portions are just as big], I give this place one more star than the other because they're just sooo sweet and nice here!  The service really makes that one-star difference.  The prices here are a bit higher than other Vietnamese restaurants but the quality and freshness of the ingredients makes up for it.

The owner came by our table personally to apologize for our 5 minute wait for a table and he stayed behind to make small talk with my little girl about her Little Mermaid doll that she had with her.  I thought he was really friendly and gracious and he definitely made this the most friendly Vietnamese restaurant I've ever dined at in the Valley.

The food was extremely delicious.  I got the Bo Kho soup and it was fantastic; hot, meaty and flavorful.  My husband had a vegetarian stir fry and my son got the vegetarian Pho and they both loved their dishes as well.  My little daughter also really enjoyed her fried spring rolls and her fresh, young coconut drink that comes served in a glass, along with the coconut meat and a serving spoon.

This restaurant is a little farther from me than I would like, but I'll definitely try to make it a regular stop when I am over in this part of the Valley.",positive
ch340,5/19/2014,revch853,5,"This place is always clean, friendly,and fast. I love the number 20 and I get it every time! Spring rolls are amazing, and always wash down with a Thai tea!",positive
ch340,5/15/2014,revch854,5,Best Chicken Pho in town! No joke! Oh and their steak and rice dish is to absolutely die for. The seasoning is perfection. (Drool!) I need to try their Vietnamese Iced Coffee if they have it. Then my heart will be sold forever. Love this place!,positive
ch340,5/14/2014,revch855,4,"This was our 1st time eating there and it was pretty good. We order PHo (#8 and 9) and also chicken egg noddles. Out food arrived in less than 15 min and the waitress was helpful and nice. The only thing I dint like was their coconut water, I'm used to the pacific coconuts, it was too sweet for my taste buds. I will come back again!",positive
ch340,5/10/2014,revch856,5,"I really like this place! I tried their beef pho and it was amazing! I will recommend this place to anybody, try it!",positive
ch340,5/4/2014,revch857,3,"I have spent three years in Tucson to try most Pho. I always think Phoenix has better than Tucson. Also, one of my colleagues recommended this place to me several month ago. I finally came and tried this weekend and was totally disappointed. The service was great. We didn't wait for table and didn't wait too long for food. (The waitress was very thoughtful. I ordered vege noodle and spring eggroll, but didn't realize the eggroll had meat/seafood or vege/tofu options. She pointed out, and let us to do half and half. Other than that I might give 2 stars.) I had Thai tea, which was not surprised. It was actually like something you could find in grocery store and make at home. My boyfriend had the #1 Pho. The soup was most disappointing part.",negative
ch340,5/3/2014,revch858,4,"Great service and wonderful food. Even when it is busy, you are always greeted and taken care of.",positive
ch340,5/3/2014,revch859,5,Yummmmy! I love this place.. Only bad thing is that's in Mekong market (which makes me spend too much money). I would come back because service and pho was pho-nomenial! ;),positive
ch340,5/1/2014,revch860,3,"Alright, so anyways.. The 3 stars I'm giving this place is not a real bad thing.  Ok, so I decided to try out this place in Mekong Plaza.  I've never had Pho before, but being the weird person I am, did not get Pho (usually try new things too).  I ended up getting the steamed rice plate (beef and shrimp.. #49)  Before I ordered, I recognized mostly everything being around $9-10 (yikes).  Anyways, the staff were very nice and friendly like everyone talks about.  The food didn't take very long to come out, so that was very cool.  

Now the dish itself.. the first thing I said to myself was ""Thats it?""  Decided to eat it anyways because I'm no fool like that.  The beef was great and the 3 little shrimps were tasty as well.  The rice was swell. Overall if the review was based off just taste, it would be 5 stars.  

The reason I've gave it 3 was because with all these Asian places I've been to $10 dishes could give you more. My brother did get some Pho, which was a pretty good size, but the other dishes can be a little small.",negative
ch340,4/28/2014,revch861,5,"The food was excellent!!! Everything tasted fresh and delightful. The staff was kind and very welcoming. . I rarely get GREAT customer service because I have three young children and they do cry and throw tantrums, but the staff here was amazing and welcomed us with a smile..My New place to come  for my pho fix and I will be recommending this place to family and friends..",positive
ch340,4/27/2014,revch862,4,"Decent pho, nothing much to brag about. Service was always excellent, being Vietnamese and I know pho pretty well, it's just a little over priced for me.",positive
ch340,4/19/2014,revch863,5,"Best Pho in the valley!!! Fresh brewed Thai and jasmine Ice tea. Easy parking and very friendly wait staff.  They close a little early, 8 pm, even on the weekend.  The menu is large but we've only tried the pho since that is our favorite.",positive

ch340,3/27/2014,revch869,3,"Great location within the Mekong Plaza. However, the Pho Dac biet price has now gone up to $9.25 a bowl now! Their quality is still decent, good broth and good amounts of meat in the soup but this is far too expensive for a bowl of Pho now. I don't think I'll be returning anytime soon until they adjust the price. If i can get a bowl of Pho for about $6.50 -$7.50 on the West side with better quality then there is no incentive to return to here anymore.",negative
ch340,3/23/2014,revch870,5,"The service is friendly and fast! The food is delicious. Take out is prepped to be put together at home so it's perfectly cooked. After our second visit the staff recognized us, and not long after they remembered our usual order. Highly recommended!",positive
ch340,3/23/2014,revch871,4,"My family love this place! My husband has celiac and this is where he could safely order delicious food without worrying about gluten. We usually order rice noodles with book tripe and beef tendons. My daughter likes their rare beef rice noodle soup.  Even my Asperger son (extremely picky eater) likes their beef broth so much he would just have rice noodles in broth.  I like their spring rolls with pork and shrimp slices. Not too expensive for being hand made.  We add it when we feel like splurging a little. 
If you are on a GF diet you need to avoid the hoisin sauce and regular soy sauce. I am not sure about the peanut sauce. Since I do not know how it is mixed.
I am giving it 4 stars because I feel while the flavor has been consistent, the portion is a bit smaller.  I remember we used to get more ""stuff"".",positive

ch340,3/19/2014,revch873,3,"I was very excited to find a place that has vegan pho, well they call it vegetarian noodle soup, but close enough! My husband got the wide noodle dish, which I liked from the few bites I snuck in. 

Overall it was good, but it didn't blow me away. I'll keep my eye out for another vegan pho in the area, but if I can't find one, I will definitely go back. Gotta have my noodles!",negative
ch340,3/18/2014,revch874,3,"I suppose you get used to your favorite Pho place and then everywhere else seems a little off? unPhogettable was like that, there was nothing bad about it, but it was a little off in my opinion. 

For one, I wasn't a fan of the huge long communal like tables in the middle of the restaurant.  We got there when it was really busy and had to sit at one.  I just like my own space!  Plus, I am fairly sure they didn't have any AC, so it was really getting warm with all that hot soup and warm bodies packed in there.  

We had attentive servers and the food came out quickly, but I wasn't wowed.  The Pho Bien (meatball) was served in a mediumish size bowl (only one size) with my own personal plate of herbs and sprouts (which was nice).  The pho was swimming in grease.  It is a personal pet peeve when places don't skim!!  The meatballs where quartered (I generally like them thinly sliced).  The problem with quartering a meatball is if it sits all day in broth cooking it will get rubbery, as these did. Other than that the broth was good.  

Pho is like pizza, even bad pho is pretty good. I would say is was OK.  It just didn't do much for me.",negative
ch340,3/18/2014,revch875,5,I've been here many times and I've loved it every time! The food is fresh and MSG free and the prices are reasonable. The service is fast and super friendly! I enjoy going to this restaurant and will continue to go here when I'm in the mood for pho.,positive
ch340,3/15/2014,revch876,3,"We now look for a Pho place every time we go on vacation anywhere. Denver has spoiled me since there is one practically on every corner.

We found this one nearby and they were packed at lunch time. There was only 1 size bowl of Pho (what I would call a medium) and I thought it seemed a little on the pricey side, although not completely out of line.

Service was fine here, although I could have used a water refill toward the end and they never came back by.

I ordered the meatball pho and the server asked if I'd ever had it before. I thought that was a little weird, but answered in the affirmative. It did make me wonder if there was something off about it, but it was all fine.

I did NOT care for the taste or texture of the meatballs when they came out. They were very thick cut and really chewy in the center. Did not work for me at all.

I also thought the Pho could've been skimmed a little better, but some places do it better than others, so not too big of a deal.

Overall, I thought it was an okay experience. I don't know that I'd come back and order the meatball.",negative
ch340,3/15/2014,revch877,2,"My wife and I have been coming here for the last 3 years.  We were always happy with the food and service.  However, on this Saturday night we left wondering what was happening to the food.  My wife order a pho dish and I ordered a vegetarian noodle dish.  My wife felt like they had cut down on the fresh ingredient dish and noodles.  My dish seemed like they cut down on the tofu and vegetables and the noodles as well.  This is the first time we left disappointed.   We'll give it another try but if they have a repeat performance of tonight we will write this restaurant off.",negative
ch340,3/5/2014,revch878,5,"Great selection of  delicious pho.  Decent prices.  Quick attentive service.  The decor is fairly utilitarian but still the darker colors and authentic Vietnamese decorations make it more than classy enough for a soup joint.  The staff was quick, friendly and attentive.  The fact that there's a great Vietnamese bakery right next door doesn't hurt come desert time, either!",positive
ch340,2/16/2014,revch879,5,"My fave pho place in the Valley!  Not only is the food delicious but the service is top notch and the restaurant itself is beautiful (definitely not a hole in the wall!).  The walls feature murals of bamboo and pretty, artistic photos of women wearing traditional Vietnamese dresses.  

The place is family-owned and on several of our visits, the owners have come and chatted at length with us--very nice people!  They WILL remember you.  Being vegetarian, I recommend the veggie pho (selection V4 on the menu), which is like a tofu/veggie explosion in a soup bowl; it has mushrooms, broccoli, cauliflower, snow peas, bok choy, cabbage, and tofu plus the bean sprouts/lime/jalapeños that come alongside.  Really fresh and good!  I also love the vegetarian egg rolls--they're unique in that they come with lettuce and pickled veggies to wrap around them--they're my favorite egg rolls I've ever had hands down!

Recommend this place highly!",positive
ch340,2/11/2014,revch880,2,"Disappointed? Yes...I have no intention in offending anyone and I apologize in advance for my bluntness.  

When I sat down waited to order, I noticed most races other than Asians came in to eat...I started to have bad feelings about the place because with the experiences that I've encountered...almost 9 out of 10 pho restaurants that has more Americans or other races other than Asians eating means the place is not going to be good or only average. The reason is...Most Asians (often Vietnamese) knows their Pho so if the PHo is WHOA and worth it then definitely they will crowd up the place...(I am not hating or anything but this is indeed true) if u disagreed or dislike what u read, please move forward to someone's else review that fit your eyes 

IMO if you're going to charge people overpriced food then you need to make it extremely good! Like out of the ordinary...

I am not a pro on food but I ate pho since I was a child and have tried tons of pho to know which ones taste good.

The pho here is not the worst but it ain't the best...it's average. 

PHO GAN (PHO W/ TENDONS ONLY) ABOUT $9 
PHO TAI (PHO w/ sliced beef) about $10
Bun thit nuong cha gio (rice noodle w/ pork meat & egg rolls) egg rolls were not cut...they gave only 1 full egg roll. About $10 something + $1 something for 1 egg roll...

The pho itself was cooked at the right level since it was soft to chew but not mushy.  Broth was clear and not oily...tendons was a bit rough (hard). It was a little difficult to bite a piece off so I had to put one whole piece in my mouth.

The sliced beef was somewhat thick...not thin enough but good thing it was fresh

The rice noodle was good...I tried a a piece of the pork and it was well marinated and not burnt up. Didn't eat the egg roll but it didn't looked tasty.

Services were eh...they mostly checked up on regular and old customers and due to the fact that most of the waitresses were not Asians...they only checked up on those who were not Asians...When asked them to bring something they weren't happy and were rushing to leave! 

Clean place",negative

UnPhogettable, that's where I am
UnPhogettable in Mekong Plaza
Like a sauce that's fishy that clings to me
How the taste of Pho does things to me
Never before have I ate this much and more

UnPhogettable in every way
Add basil's and lime, that's how I'll roll
That's why, darling, it's incredible
That some place like UnPhogettable 
Thinks that I am UnPhogettable too!

UnPhogettable is one to remember when it comes to Pho restaurants.  Every ones trying to be creative and this one definitely catches the eye and ears.  

UnPhogettable is located right at the entrance of Mekong Plaza, an Asian grocery store, which is a prime location.  One of the first to open around that area so kudos to jump and the wagon so quick.  

I ordered the Pho of course and so did my friend.  Nice warm to hot broth is important to me and this place didn't disappoint.  The beef round is which I'm used to is not used here unfortunately.  Instead it's cut into a triangular shaped and much small portions.  Too bad, cause that would have been the way I liked it.  The side condiments came in a small saucer dish.  Now I can appreciate that cause I only use so much.  For those of you that loves a lot of basil, cilantro, jalapeno, and bean sprouts...you will be disappointed.  

Overall, the Pho doesn't blow my mind, but it's okay.  Service hits with a bang and I enjoy the black t-shirt uniforms instilled here.  Most Pho restaurants don't even have uniforms. - Enjoy!",negative
ch340,2/1/2014,revch883,5,"This is my favorite pho place, and I've tried a couple others in the valley. The service is the fast, the staff is friendly (and remember you if you're a regular), and the food is yummy! I love the peanut sauce that accompanies the spring rolls and the pho hits the spot every time.",positive
ch340,1/30/2014,revch884,2,I LOVE pho & wanted to get a quick pho near the Mekong grocery store so we came in. I'm only one year new to Phoenix & have been trying as many pho places as possible. The service was quick but the servers we short & rude. I ordered the pho with everything. This place may be called unphogettable but my pho was very phogettable. It was under average & the prices are the most expensive that I've seen in Phoenix. I will not be coming here for pho again.,negative
ch340,1/27/2014,revch885,4,"This is a good, clean place if you want some Vietnamese food.  I am not a huge fan of their pho (and I've lived in Los Angeles and San Diego where I have been exposed to amazing pho), but the rest of their food is good.  I specifically love the S5 which is the egg noodle soup with duck. I have had this dish at many other places and never has it been as good as it is here because most other places make it too sweet.  The service here is also great, and I have met the owner and his wife on several occasions and both are really great people and really care about their customers. Ingredients are always fresh such as the jalapenos and basil given on the side. And there are TVs if you want to stop by during a game that you don't want to miss.",positive

We were recommended by one of the waitress to try the Pho since is the usual dish they serve there and how is served (big plus)...

So we ordered a number 1 (all meats Pho), a number 21 (Shrimp Pho) and an A1 (spring rolls appetizer)...

After trying the appetizers we were surprised by the taste and couldn't wait for the main dish to arrive...

Once they arrived, we started eating (although we had some issues handling the chopsticks) and i was blown away...

i would definitely go back for more...",positive
ch340,1/12/2014,revch888,5,"Everything here is $2 more than any other pho place in the valley I've been to, but I will gladly pay it because their broth is MAGICAL!!!

The flavor just keeps going and going and going....you take a spoonful of it in your mouth and the flavors just seep sweetly into your tongue. It is amazing. I love it. This was the first pho I tried in the valley, and every other place I go to just cannot live up to it (although I do love how much cheaper the other places are lol). 

I have never eaten dine-in here, I have only done pickup during my lunch break. I love calling ahead, picking up a couple things from mekong market and swinging by to get my magical broth. 

This place has definitely lived up to it's name.",positive

ch340,12/18/2013,revch891,2,"This is quite a turnaround from my prior visits to Unphogettable and from my last review.  I dropped by today to have some PHOs which my husband, in particular, adores.  It is probably his favorite Vietnamese indulgence.  We ordered chicken phos only to find the broth to be almost tasteless (the word almost is my concession).  I found the chicken meat to be rather strange-- thick slices of what appeared to be chicken but tasted more like turkey breast.  Is that so bad you ask? Well, I found the meat to have a tough, flavorless consistency.  As a cook, I have a feeling that the broth was created with some commercial bouillon and then pieces of chicken? turkey? were thrown in.  This makes sense considering that most of their menu is soup based.  They have to be using alternative ways of creating broth. When I make chicken soup, the meat in its bone creates the broth and then you pull the meat off the bone and voila! a delicious, meaty  chicken broth.  This was not the case here.
It was probably the worst PHO we have had in a long time.  My husband commented that the PHO we had in Paris, France was one hundred percent better than this PHO??  Can you believe the french make better PHO than Vietnamese in Mesa?  I remember the PHO in Paris so I can't disagree.  The point here is that Unphogettable better step up its game because you can live on your past reputation for only so long.  I did notice that there were not many ethnics eating here only non-vietnamese locals.  I am beginning to wonder if these people are the ones rating the place 4 and 5 stars when Unphogettable no longer serves good food and has basically lost its mojo.  BTW, a little research led me to fact that their regular chef is no longer there.  
I ,  for one , am NOT returning either.

ch340,12/9/2013,revch892,5,"Okay. I know there are several places to try but this place by far is the best in the east valley for Pho. The staff are friendly & eager to please your appetite. The Pho Ga is our families favorite. I prefer my order with half vegatables & chicken. The broth alone is delicious if you don't like to add spicy hot sauce or sweet hoisin sauce. The staff also recommended the combonation fried rice. It is the best tasting fried rice I've had in a very long time. It has chunks of bbq pork ribs, chicken & a few shrimp which i don't mind because the balance works well together. The spring rolls are also a great appetizer w/ peanut dipping sauce. Overall it's the best having ate other Pho joints in rural & local areas.",positive

ch340,12/3/2013,revch895,5,We just got done having an early dinner here and it was excellent! My boyfriend had the beef Pho and I had the chicken Mi Ga. Absolutely flavorful and just all out delicious! The staff was friendly and was courteous as well as accommodating when we let them know of my boyfriend's shellfish allergy. They actually helped him pick a safer broth. The portions are huge so we'll have plenty for lunch tomorrow too. I can't wait to come back here! This place truly is unPhogettable!,positive
ch340,11/22/2013,revch896,4,"I've come here probably half a dozen times now. Not only do I go around to restaurants and eat pho, I also make it at home. I like taking the lazy way sometimes and going out to eat instead of nursing a pot for a third of the day. This place is where I like to go whenever I'm in the area or going to Mekong. 

The food is delicious. The beef broth in my beef pho was flavorful and not overly salty. 

Parking is plentiful of course from being in a shopping plaza. 

The eggrolls are delicious. They're not stuffed with nothing but vegetables like other places. 

The prices are reasonable. Higher than what I pay at my corner spot but in a better location so I could reason why the price would be a hair higher.

The place is medium sized and clean. CLEAN is how I like my Asian restaurants. 

The owner is a nice guy and the staff is friendly.

One worker went on to say that even if I tried and put the money in their apron, they would still get in trouble if they don't give it to the owners. There are cameras everywhere. I thought that was kind of sad..so I rate this place a 2 star for good pho but bad business pratice.

It's unPhogettable but not in a good way.  The broth was a little too strong.  I think the cook added too much star anise so it was quite overwhelming.  DH ordered Bun Bo Hue.  He said it was only okay.  My friends also ordered Pho bo and they thought the same thing.  The service was excellent.  Our waitress kept asking if we needed anything else.  

The owner also came over to say hi and asked about the food.  I wasn't sure if I should tell her the truth or not.  I ended up telling her that everything was great.  I should have told her what I thought of her broth and maybe she should go easy on the star anise.  Oh well... maybe next time.

Never before has something been more

And forever more, that's how you'll stay

That something so unPHOgettable
Thinks that I'm unforgettable too

Lyrics by Pho King Cole

I'm a sucker for that golden life blood broth that like the sun to superman recharges me from my drunken escapades. Granted it's not the best, lets face it, this is Arizona, the hotbed of Vietnamese cuisine, right?

Told by people in the know that this is the best they have and that if I'm in need to come here. Yes I was in needs. Hungover and feeling like a penny I looked like I just spend 40 days in the desert instead of 40 hours in the city.

Went with my standard spring rolls and large pho with extra tripe and meatballs, no tendon or flank. Soup was clean of debris from the parboil. Not oily slicked, but to me could use a deeper degree of coriander and spices. Noodles were looks and not packed at the bottom, plenty of room to mix and generous condiments. Spring rolls were tight, light, but could use more noodles. Peanut sauce could have the crumbled peanuts be more pronounced. Light on the fish sauce. An excellent meal.

I was surprised they had a sister store in Virginia Beach, soo far from Arizona. 

The next day, same sob story, hurting from the night before I treid the Mi Vit Tiem, roasted duck leg soup, earthy, not gamey, rich and flavorful, but didn't have the same effect as my beloved pho. Kind of classy. 

Service is great, totally family run. Prices are average, parking is stripmall ish and plenty. The Vietnamese coffee was the only real downfall. Kind of weak in my opinion. Just thick and I had to ask for extra ice. Not bad for Arizona.

Love how they open at 9am, but close really early between 8-8:30.",positive

Overpriced and bad food.  I am never eating there ever again.",negative
ch340,10/23/2013,revch905,4,I'm from Central California and this Phò place is not bad compares to the ones I been to. They are still flavorful and delicious. However they do need a few more side ingredient and it will be amazingly awesome! But I definitely recommend this place to eat delicious phò!,positive
ch340,10/21/2013,revch906,5,"My wife loves this kind of food. Not so much myself. Great quality food in just a meet and potatoes kinda guy. Service here is impeccable. These people got their shit together. If Asian cuisine is your thing, then this place is truly unphogetable.",positive
ch340,10/17/2013,revch907,3,"I'm really not a fan.  But I could be bias because I lived in So Cal, and grew up eating San Gabriel Valley and Garden Grove pho really makes you a pho connoisseur.  My boyfriend did warn me to lower my expectations but for a place that has this many good reviews I would imagine it being good. I don't think I got my pho fix, the portions are small.  Gave it an extra star because the staff are really attentive and nice.",negative
ch340,9/28/2013,revch908,5,My family has been coming here for two years.  We have vegetarians in our group who are always able to find something to eat.  The kids love the chicken wings.

We always order the #9 (beef pho) and the combination fried rice. Both are delicious. The fried rice is very light and not greasy - my daughter loves it, it is a very big portion, so be prepared to box it up (it does reheat very well too).

I recommend this place over any of the other pho restaurants in the area - by far the best we've had.",positive

But what about the food?

Having lived in Singapore and traveled through Asia, this is one of the most authentic Viet restaurants I've been lucky to visit on this side of the Pacific.  Portions are not huge but more than satisfied.  And the taste was spot on, very fresh and authentic.

Props also for the nice modern decor, so refreshing in a world of cheesy Asian restaurants with hi-five kitties behind the register.  

We'll be back for sure.",positive
ch340,9/2/2013,revch917,5,So good. The bowls of pho are huge and served up quick. Service is top notch and this place stays busy. The peanut sauce that comes with the spring rolls is the best!,positive

ch340,8/23/2013,revch920,4,Love this place! I am a huge fan of the # 9 but my new fav is #24. This place is very clean and always full of customers. They keep the A/C on and it's nice and cool just like it should be in the summertime. The employees here are awesome too. Always very nice and seem to remember everyone! That's the kind of restaurant I love!!,positive
ch340,8/10/2013,revch921,4,"Pho Tai here was A-ok

Was happy to see all the condiments around as well as fish sauce.

ch340,7/22/2013,revch924,4,"If you are a Pho-natic like I am you will really like this place.  The broth is fantastic. They cook the beef bones and herb/spice broth for nearly 24hr.  The meet is fresh and tender. Lots of noodles and friendly service. 
One of the owners came to our table and had us try a few new things. It was refreshing to see a place the gets great reviews and stands up to its reputation.
I would certainly visit again.",positive
ch340,7/9/2013,revch925,3,"This is the first time we had eatten Pho and did not really know what to expect or for that matter what it really was.  Turns out it is broth, noodles, some veggies and different types of beef or chicken or seafood, but you probably already knew that. I had the number 1 (can't remember what it was called).  It was a beef broth with noodles and I added the veggies.  It had beef brisket, flank steak, beef tripe and tendon and beef meatballs.  It sounds like a lot but trust me it wasn't.  I mean there was a lot of noodles and broth but the meat and veggie portions were extremely skimmpy.  (Hence the 3 star rating)  The meat was also a little on the bland side but if you mixed the hot sauces in with it, it tasted better.  My girlfriend had the number 9 which included beef brisket and flank steak.  She also thought the same as I, but for some reason hers had an almost overpowering taste of cinnimon.  The service was beyond great and the lady that was either the owner or manager came to our table and talked to us for a few minutes.  She explained everything and also gave us suggestions.  We also had the soft spring rolls as an appetizer.  One thing I didn't expect was that they were served cold.  I think that we will probably go back and try it again but order something different.",negative

ch340,6/9/2013,revch929,3,"I used to make fun of unPhogettable. Because their pho was very forgettable. But then their flavor has gotten better recently and they're more fully staff now. Which means better service!!! That is the most improved aspect.

Blue Moon used to be my choice because it was super cheap but not that great. Now they raised prices and it's still not that great. And then there was that other pho place on Southern and Extension that had a double murder occur which made it shut down. Now that place was good but it's closed indefinitely.

Now back to this place...

I usually order the Beef pho #1 and like I said, flavor is getting better. It's probably your best bet in the Tempe/Mesa area so I recommend that you give this place a try. I think soon, they will earn my 4th star.",negative
ch340,6/2/2013,revch930,2,Have been to this place many times. Would visit it twice a week. Such a regular that the server already knew my order. Last time I was there I found a worm in my soup. All they did was offer an apology and that's it. Even though I did not even eat half of my food they still made me pay for it. It's unfortunate that the food is good but treatment to loyal customers is so bad.,negative
ch340,6/2/2013,revch931,4,"The pho here is the best I have ever had - amazing broth.  The other food, I would not recommend.  There is another place just a couple of blocks away with better spring rolls/pork/shrimp/beef.  

Again, pho here is simply perfect.  But the meat dishes here are usually overlooked - beef has that over cooked beef taste, pork in the spring rolls also has that overlooked tasted, and the shrimps are cooked to the point of being dry.",positive
ch340,5/28/2013,revch932,4,"Being a Californian from Los Angeles has spoiled me because I never knew that Vietnamese food could get so expensive lol. Over $10 for a bowl of pho that is considered a size small in the SGV? WHAT? 

Anyway, I don't like pho. Never did, never will. So obviously I didn't try the pho here but I did get the vermicelli with egg rolls and pork, as well as the bi cuon and those two were okay. The vermicelli was sweeter than the ones in LA for some reason (maybe it's that fish sauce) and for $9, I guess it's okay. 2 small rolls of bi cuon for $5 was a blasphemy to me because back in the LA or even the OC, we could get 4 rolls for the same price that tasted much better. But, the ones here were still decent so I'm not complaining.

Overall: Food is good, prices could be better but hey since they don't have much competition, I guess it's okay.",positive
ch340,5/20/2013,revch933,5,"Best pho I have found. My friend and I have ""Pho Phridays"" and eat there every time we want pho. Fresh ingredients every time and everyone there is super friendly.

I've tried other restaurants that serve pho, from holes in the wall to fancy places and nothing still nothing compares to this place. The crispy pork rolls are out of this world. Service can be better thats why I gave it four stars. To make this review simple...this place is unpho-king-believable.",positive

The service is excellent and fast. When we ask for extra limes, they bring them and do not charge extra (some places charge for little things like this).  

The pho is in a huge bowl and comes with the usual extras.  I tend to always bring home leftovers, just a tasty the next day.

I love that they have vegetarian pho (with tofu and veggies instead of meat) and the service is incredible - you can tell they really love their business and their customers.  I will absolutely be stopping here whenever I'm in the area.

FYI, they don't serve beer/booze, but you can buy it in the market next door and bring it in!",positive
ch340,4/8/2013,revch943,3,"I gotta say the pho was ok at best. The broth was bland and there was not much meat nor noddles. The ""fixings"" were lacking as well. Service was fine, but with so many pho options in the valley I find it hard press to return.",negative

The waitress was snotty and literally couldn't do the basic math necessary for me to pay my bill (gave her a $20 bill and she sat there like 'um, 20 minus 12.44 is....uh....uh....').

ch340,3/26/2013,revch947,5,"So I have never tried Pho before and my friend and I went to try this restaurant. He has already had it and he loves it and said that i absolutely needed to try it:) 

We went and it was super packed! We went on a Sunday night. It was very lively. 

We decided to get the veggie pho with tofo in it. We saw from the reviews that the portions are generous and we don't eat too much food at once, so we decided to split it.  and it was definitely more than enough! We also ordered the shrimp and pork spring rolls as an appetizer with that peanut sauce and omgoshhh that was sooo yummmyyyyyy. Never had that before and it was amazing! and also a side of white rice- which is always yummy in my book :)

I absolutely loved the pho! love how they fried the tofo, because im kinda iffy when it comes to tofu but this was really yummy. i didnt add to much sauce to it, just jalapeno for spice and i added the additional veggies. 

for someone who has never had pho i really enjoyed this meal and i tend to crave it alot! i will definitely be coming back here!!! I also love the plaza/mall that they have! very nice :)",positive
ch340,3/18/2013,revch948,4,"I was visiting from CT and when compared to my local pho, this pho restaurant is great.  The portions are large and the price is inexpensive.  The broth is rich and smooth.  The restaurant asked if I understood what I was ordering; to be certain I would not get an unpleasant surprise.  The owner came to check on us to make sure we had a great meal.  I would definitely recommend.",positive
ch340,3/18/2013,revch949,4,"We live right around the corner from the Mekong Plaza, so this is our go-to place for Pho and good Vietnamese. The portions are more than generous, my partner and I can usually share a bowl and still leave more than satisfied. I don't think I've ever had a bad meal here. Both the beef and chicken based broths are flavourful, the cuts of meat are excellent. Neither of us have ever ended up with a fatty or chewy piece of meat, be it beef or chicken. Even my partner's 10 year old inhaled the Pho, and he's a picky little guy! 

Try the Vietnamese version of diamond ice for dessert, if you like trying new things. Made with coconut milk instead of condensed milk, it's a refreshing way to cool off once the weather gets hot. 

Whether you get Pho or one of the rice or vermicelli dishes, you'd be hard-pressed to find a dish that was really good. Add that to the super friendly and attentive staff, and you've got one very highly recommended Vietnamese restaurant! 

The only reason I'm giving it 4 instead of 5 stars is because of the price. Bowls of Pho are $8-$9, which is a little high comparatively. If they could drop the price a couple bucks, they'd easily be a 5 star!",positive
ch340,3/9/2013,revch950,4,"I normally want to avoid a kitschy place like this that white-washes everything. Well, it proved me wrong.

This place had the most outstanding service of any place, pho or otherwise, that I've been to, especially on a packed Friday evening. Quick table, ordering, and constantly making sure I was doing good. It took a little longer for the pho, but when it's a packed house, it's understandable. They seemed to work quick and hard there, even fixing up some messed up orders at the table next to me.

Had a typical pho tai, which was served already in the broth. Again, understandable to help ease health concerns, but still trying to find a place where I can cook it to my liking. The broth is as the other reviewers have said: flavorless. I had to mix in other condiments, but I did like their version of sriracha. Price point was also a negative as well.

Overall, it was a fine place, with the only dings being the price and bland broth, but the service really makes me like being there. I would definitely be open to future visits.",positive
ch340,3/3/2013,revch951,4,It's good although portions could be a little bigger. Located outside of a grocery store which is useful to keep their ingredients fresh. They probably just go to the store when they run out of veggies or something. Freshest veggies I have seen at a Pho place. I'll definitely stop by again the next time I'm in Arizona.,positive

ch340,2/28/2013,revch953,5,"I absolutely love this place.  I have never had a bad meal here and I don't understand the bad reviews I see.  The soup is always so incredibly hot and delicious - the meat is plentiful and tender.  The staff and the owner are always friendly and nearby for any of your needs.   The only reason they close early is because they sometimes run out of soup.  This is an intricate soup that has to cook for many hours before being served.  
Thanks unPHOgettable!!",positive
ch340,2/26/2013,revch954,3,"I feel weird saying this as criticism... but where is my beef tripe?  I asked for tripe, along with flank steak in my beef pho, but I came off feeling like some sort of rich guy.  I dunno... there's something to all those non-choice cuts of animals that makes a meal authentic.

Alright, the pho portion sizes are huge, the broth is quite flavorful and served acceptably hot (could be scalding-ier though), the vermicelli is good (hard to screw that up), cuts of meat were tender, greens abundant.  A solid bowl.

I'm less impressed with their Bun Bo Hue.  The noodles are very tender, again cuts of meat are tender, but there is absolutely no heat to the broth.  Also, I'm not sure if it's a culinary choice by unPhogettable chefs, but no congealed blood?

Service is quick and the staff is very friendly.  Despite being a sit-down restaurant with table service, the atmosphere inside has a very cafeteria feel.  (It's hard to put in words, but when you step inside, it makes more sense)  Prices are a bit on the high side for a pho joint, but still very reasonable and by no means expensive.  Portion sizes are large.  Definitely more trips for the pho, but as a Bun Bo Hue afficionado, that was a bit disappointing.",negative
ch340,2/19/2013,revch955,3,"this place didn't live up to the hype!

I love pho, and usually I am not picky about broth, but I felt the broth here was really flavorless. on top of that, the beef was pretty tough. and for $8/bowl, I wasn't feeling it.

the positives are that the servers are friendly (although a little too pushy - when my friend asked what drinks they had, the server turned to the back of the menu and insisted on reading through every single item; also we were asked 4 different times what drinks we wanted; AND 4 different times if we were ready to order). also they give you plenty of bean sprouts, mint, and lime for your pho. and it is clean.",negative

Now a days not so much, you see the last couple times I've shown up 45 minutes before closing (1st time) then an hour and fifteen minutes (2nd time) they've told me they were closed. Kind of bullshit to have a different time listed on your door if you ask me! Anyways, decent for pho. That's all I recommend there though.",negative

I have visited this place 4 times now.

First trip: with my wife and daughter.
Food was good, egg rolls good, then main course. It took 20 minutes for then to bring us 1 pho (for my wife), and 1 rice vermicelli with pork (only dish I ever eat).
My dish was good, and seemed like the portion was big, until my pork disappeared and the only thing left was lettuce. I think they included a small head of lettuce, little bit of noodles, and a tiny amount of meat.

Second trip: by myself since my wife delivered our second baby girl, and I wanted to surprise her with comfort food.
Ordered a chicken Pho, and kids chicken Pho (for my daughter) to go.
Server girl tells me that they do not make kids pho to go. Now I'm mad, but don't want to make a scene. I ask if I can get a side of noodles to go, in which she says ""yes"". I ask if I can get a small side of pho soup to go, in which she says ""yes"". Chicken? ""yes""
I'm thinking WTF is different from child's pho than what I ordered?
Took my order and left no tip due to her stupidity!

Third trip: with my wife, mom, and our now two daughters.
Pretty much same order as first trip, but my mom ordered same as me.
My wife, being Vietnamese didn't learn English until her late teens, always orders in Vietnamese (hey we are in a Vietnamese restaurant right?). I guess either the server we had didn't know Vietnamese, or was of a different nationality because no matter what my wife said, she ignored my wife and kept asking ""what number?""
Again my food (and my moms) was pretty much a whole head of lettuce, little noodles, and little meat.

Fourth trip: with my wife, our two daughters, my mom, and my moms husband.
Almost same order as last time, but I ordered rice vermecilli with beef, my mom and my wife order it with pork, and my step father orders pho.
All of our food comes out, and again a whole head of lettuce, bla bla bla.
But wait, my wife's food is not here, and the server is at the othe side of the place laughing and chatting with friends. Everyone is pretty much finished, and still no food for my wife. I go get the server and tell her that my wife didn't get her food. She comes over and tells my wife that she is not sure what happened. She goes to the kitchen, then comes back and says she forgot to order it for us, but put it in now. My wife tells her ""okay, please remember it needs to be Pork. 
A little bit later the server brings her rice vermecilli with beef.
My wife tells her ""I ordered Pork, and I reminded you that it was pork"". 
The server tells my wife ""no, you order beef. I heard you say beef"".
Then almost at the same time, my mom and I tell her very loudly ""I ORDERED BEEF, AND IT WAS OVER 30 MINUTES AGO!!!"". 
So now the server is just standing there mumbling something, but does not offer to fix it or anything, she just keeps standing there. 
So my mom says she will eat the beef, and we will take the rest home and add pork to it for my wife. 
As I dump it into a to go box, my wife says ""wow, that must be a whole head of lettuce there"". Finally I was not the only one to notice.
My mom offered to pay, and as we were walking out, the owner says ""do you want me to replace meat with pork?""

Even though the food was descent tasting, we will never go back there again after those repeated experiences.

Their horrible service deffinately makes them unphogettable, but in a bad way.",negative

I didn't like that they did not give my son a menu, he can read his 13.  Anyways we started out with the egg rolls and I got  Pho with meat and  my son got the chicken breast with rice and a child's pho for my little girl.  When the egg rolls came I was like WTH really iceberg lettuce to wrap my egg rolls : ( . Not impressed . Then it took awhile for our soups and entree to come out and when it arrived... DISAPPOINTMENT!!! Now everybody should  know that the broth is what matters and it tasted like chicken/beef broth, the beansprouts and basil looked sad.  The basil looked like it was picked over. My sons chicken didn't look like a chicken breast.  It looked like they took half of the breast and half it again then smash it flat.  it was too sweet and uneatable.

It's a smaller restaurant with TV's around and tables for big groups and couples. I ordered my chicken pho to go and waited only 5 minutes (I didn't call ahead to order just walked in). Staff was very friendly and even offered me a glass of water while I waited. The pho itself is a very generous portion and for those that have never had it, it's like a soup on steroids!

Finally got to try it for lunch. with him when I visited and he was right! Out of the other Pho places he had taken me to around Phoenix, this is the most legit pho you can get!  The broth and noodles tastes the same as the ones we have in LA. Thank you Vietnamese chefs who makes good broth!

By the way, if you get super full off the food, you can walk around the market! It's an Asian market, so if you live in a area that only has Albert-son, Fry's or Ralph you should definitely stop by for some Asian grocery shopping, maybe you can make some at home and enjoy a Vietnamese meal ;)

Took my family to Scottsdale for R&R and got tired of eating at chain restaurants.  Decided to look for more interesting eatery and found a Vietnamese place near the resort.  Yelp reviews were really bad.  One of the reviews mentioned Unphogettable.  When I looked up Unphogettable on Yelp, there were many positive reviews.  Although the restaurant was 20 miles away, we took a chance and glad we did.

This was the first Pho restaurant that I've been to where staff were attentive.  Owner came by to ask if everything was ok.  Wow!  That was the first.

Fresh sprouts and greens on the side with a couple slices of pepper and a lime, some great chili sauce and a bit of bean curd sauce on the side - bam.

Very impressive.  

We couldn't wait to get home to try it and we were starving so we started digging in on the way home... :)  I LOVED the salad, the spring rolls were also very good. The sausage one was my fav, I love the cilantro.  The sweet chili sauce was my fav. I usually love the peanut kind, but that was the only thing I didn't get wowwed by, it was good but not great.

Our server was excellent. She was attentive, friendly and very helpful. She did a good job holding a real conversation with us through out the evening.

For our meal we started with the Pork Belly. It was great. It is a small portion that can only be shared by two or three people. The flavors were on point though. For my meal I ordered a Filet Mignon with Blue Cheese Crust and Bearnaise Sauce on the side. The steak was prepared perfectly. The flavors of the steak, crust and sauce combined for a great taste.

For our sides we chose the Sweet Corn Pudding and the Mac & Cheese. The mac & cheese was creamy, rich and had good flavor. It is a solid side. The corn pudding, though, is fantastic. This was a great surprise. It sounds kind of boring and plain, but it had great flavor and textures. Definitely give it a try. You will not be disappointed.",positive

Our server on the other hand, was delightful. Very friendly and attentive. We started with the tartare and the beet salad. Both were yummy. The tartare had truffles shaved on it, so win in my book. My husband got the filet and I got the ribeye. He loved his filet, my ribeye was nothing to write home about. Definitely not the best steak I've ever had. The truffle fries, while good, were over hyped by the Yelpers on here. We also got the carrots and while they were good - they weren't amazing. 

I did love my cocktail. It had a bit of heat to it, which I really liked.

Myself and one other ordered the 7 oz filet, hubby got the short rib and another got the ahi tuna steak.  We also got sides of mac & cheese and green beans.  The sides are $12 and small and are really meant for 2, not 4 but we managed.

The mood of the restaurant is romantic, sophisticated, and hip. Yes, the music is a tad louder than normal but it just adds to the playful atmosphere, and hey I like a little extra stimulation in Vegas.
We ordered a couple appetizers, the beef carpaccio and fois gras waffles. the Fois gras waffles were absolutely spectacular. The creamy fois gras melted tenderly with  You must order this. The beef carpaccio was great as well, it was served with a bit of pesto angel hair pasta. Very fresh tasting compared to the savory fois gras waffles, so it was a good balance.

For main course, there was a Thanksgiving Prix Fixe menu available, but really I came for the steak, so of course I ordered the bone-in ribeye with truffle butter on top. It was the tastiest steak I've had in Vegas so far. The meat was cooked perfectly with just the right amount of seasonings. You don't actually need the extra toppings.
My friend who did order the Thanksgiving prix fixe dinner enjoyed it just as much. It came with a main dish of turkey served two ways; traditional turkey breast and delicious breaded dark meat. It came with generous servings of all your favorite sides.

Weak weak weak. Bogus.",negative

Even though I do not eat meat, STK had plenty of seafood/veggie options for me to pick from. Only complaint would be that our server overly explained every dish on the menu to us but since its Vegas and inside a hotel I'm assuming his customers food knowledge ranges far more than the typical upscale steak house.",positive

After you order your food, they bring out some house bread which was pretty good. For appetizer, I shared the Tuna tartare. It was so good but the portion is pretty small.  It's good to share maybe with 1 other person. I shared the bone in rib steak (20 oz) and good thing I shared because both me and my sister couldn't even finish our own half!  The steak was sooo good. It was so flavorful without a topping or sauce. It was charred perfectly. Probably one of the best steaks I've eaten.  We also ordered the trio mac n cheese which was off the menu. It was regular mac n cheese, lobster, and truffle. This was good enough for 4 people. My favorite was the truffle mac n cheese.  We also shared the Brussels sprouts with bacon, also off the menu, and it was delicious. Just an FYI, the trio mac n cheese is $55. 

We also got drinks which were on the pricey side.

We were given some food credit at the Cosmopolitan so we decided to use it at STK. We ordered the tuna tartare as an appetizer. It was pretty small to share for 4 people but is pretty good for 2. It tasted very delicious for the small portion it was. The house bread they offered was really good. For the main course, I ordered the bone-in rib steak. The steak was to die for. The steak was really tender and full of flavor. You didn't need to have extra sauces or toppings. It was fine as is. We also ordered the 3 mac and cheese side and also the brussels sprouts. The sides were pretty bomb! Just beware, the 3 mac and cheese side was around $55. It isn't on the menu but it was really good and glad we ordered it.

The inside of the restaurant is really nice. The decor is very modern. It is located inside of the Cosmopolitan on the 3rd floor. I'd definitely eat here again if I could. The steak was amazing and definitely worth trying!",positive

Music very loud, but we've been here before so its expected.  Very good old school hip hop surprisingly.  I had the 34 cowboy ribeye cooked perfectly and tasted great!  Bok choy and oysters were excellent too.",positive

Steaks were medium, asked for medium rare so no huge loss.  Great flavor. Truffle butter was pricey but with it. Only miss was the lobster risotto, tough to get right though. 

Highlight outside of the food was the vibe of this place. It's fun, music was great. Never too loud though.

ch458,10/30/2014,revch1029,3,"I've eaten here twice so far, and I really love the atmosphere if you are trying to eat a nice steakhouse type dinner, but have a club like feeling at the same time. It's a fun, cool vibe if you are having dinner or drinks with friends. The music is always on point, but extremely loud, so if you're looking for an intimate quiet date night, this probably wouldn't be the place for you. The first time I went here, the food was good and a gf and I shared the medium sized ribeye which was cooked perfectly from what I can remember. The whole group of 6 girls shared about 3 or 4 different sides which were more than enough. 
The second time I went here though, the experience was not at all the same. Since we came with guys this time, the hubby and I were going to share the cowboy ribeye which is on the larger side. The waitress told us it would be a bit of a wait of about 30-45 mins since the cut was thicker, but said she would tell them to rush the order so the food would come out the same time as the rest of our group. We told her we didn't mind waiting, and we understood it may take longer. The food arrived....all at the same time. Now that wouldn't be a problem normally, but when I got my steak which I ordered to be cooked medium, the inside was ok, but the outside was COMPLETELY burnt, like I mean, charcoal burnt! When we ate it, I couldn't even taste the flavor of the steak, all I could taste was charcoal...bleh! Even my husband who likes burnt food, actually couldn't take it anymore. We realized after, that they were about an hour from closing time and were rushing to get the orders out. An hour to closing when I got my food, not when I put my order in btw. I mean, if I'm going to pay $85 for the steak alone, please take your time and cook it correctly! That left a bad taste in my mouth (literally) so I probably won't be making a trip back. I did leave 3 stars since my first experience wasn't as horrible, our server was super friendly this time, and the creamed corn was REALLY good! However, for a place that specializes in steak, they need to make that their priority.",negative
ch458,10/27/2014,revch1030,5,"Heaven on a plate is called STK. 

Oh my Lord. Could you not taste anything more divine? Now, I've heard a lot of things about the popular Las Vegas STK: both good and bad. But the talk is not just talk; the talk is all true.

We ordered a little bit of everything as all foodies do, in attempt to reveal the man behind the curtain (or kitchen) and see if the popular restaurant was what it was all cracked up to be. The steak was amazing; the chicken was delicious, but my ultimate favorite were the donuts. I have not, I repeat, HAVE NOT had any dessert quite like it. I actually have foodie remorse that I didn't eat dessert for dinner...hey, when in Vegas! 

The Brussel sprouts were not my favorite rendition of this beloved veggie, but they were still better than I expected. If you're looking for a few sides, feel free to pass on that one. 

But our server Collin and now favorite Las Vegas person alive, really set our experience over the top. I've never had a fun, talkative, experienced and attentive server like him before--anywhere. If every server were like him, every restaurant would be enticing.

I ordered the blue cheese salad, carmelized asparagus and Kobe sliders as my entree which was met with icy silence from our, admittedly, awesome server who went to NECI. The asparagus was wonderful, the salad was salad-like and I was embarrassed to ask them to burn my sliders and they came out 'medium' if medium means purple. Apparently this is how you're supposed to eat these, so no deduction for me being a shut-in. We said no to dessert so our server brought a platter with fried sweet potato doughnuts, salted caramel gelato and ginger snaps. This increased her tip by twice what the dessert would have cost us so props to NECI. The people at my table who more closely resembled adults all were thrilled with their Filet, Sole and pumpkin ravioli. My seasonal boycott of all things pumpkin prevented me from sampling. I had three vodkas to close.",positive
ch458,10/27/2014,revch1032,4,"Such a nice surprise for my birthday trip to Vegas.  I wanted somewhere fun, good, and not too expensive to have a birthday dinner and this was perfect.

PARKING: It's located in Cosmo, on the 3rd floor.  If you park in self-parking you have to walk kind of far because it's located near the lobby.

ATMOSPHERE: The inside is dark and trendy.  With hanging ball lights and cool fixtures.  I made reservations for 6pm because we had to get to the club early and it was slightly crowded, but I'm sure it gets more crowded later on at night.  It was perfect for a fancy birthday dinner.  We got a half booth half table with 3 people sitting on chairs.  For attire I could see you getting away with a nice skirt and top, fancy top and jeans or dress.  You can't be overdressed here.

I heard the music was super loud and fun, which makes the dinner experience better but at 6pm the music was kind of soft and more old school.  I think as the night went on it got louder and they were slowly making their way into the 90s but we didn't stay long enough to experience it.  

FOOD: 

STEAK - Their cheapest steak is like $39 and they have a lot of other options but if you don't like steak I wouldn't come here.  My suggestion is to share the steak with someone else because it is pretty big and expensive.  My boyfriend and I shared the bone in rib steak (basically the rib eye) and it was plenty for both of us.  The steak itself doesn't come with anything so it's recommended you get sides ($12 each!) We got 4 to share among the 8 of us and it was plenty.  Beware though because we got the truffle mac n cheese and that was more than $12.  You can get ""toppings"" on top of your steak but it's not needed.  The steak itself is very flavorful and tasty without anything.

SIDES -
Truffle mac n cheese - The mac was the round short pastas usually in macaroni salad and I really liked that.  A good crust on the top with a yummy truffle flavor and pretty creamy mac n cheese.

Truffle parmesan fries - They are thickly cut and are more like potato rectangles than fries.  They are stacked like Jenga and have parmesan and truffle oil on them. They were a little too potato-y and thick for my liking but everyone at the table loved them.

Mushroom pot pie - A weird side but it was literally a pot pie with mushrooms, onions and a creamy sauce inside.  It tasted like truffle but I don't even know if it had truffle.  The top is a light crust, which wasn't that flaky and pretty thin.

Bok Choy - Weird for a steak place but it was kinda spicy.  Very flavorful though with lots of soy sauce and garlic.  Not bad actually for some greens.

Overall very impressed with STK.  I thought it would be more for the atmosphere but the food was really good! They even brought me out this chocolate cake/mousse for my birthday with a candle :)",positive
ch458,10/26/2014,revch1033,5,"Very expensive, but although my steak was overdone, which is usually unforgivable, the food was excellent on the whole. The sweet potato doughnuts and sticky toffee pudding were the highlights for me. I was dreading the DJ music but it surprisingly made for a very nice evening. They played a lot of older music and maybe we sat far enough away that it wasn't too loud. Excellent service.

ch458,10/25/2014,revch1034,1,"Listen, people: maybe it was waiting until 11:15 PM to be seated, maybe it was the ear-splitting music which forced us to use our other senses, maybe it was purely hunger delirium -- but it was the best steak and sides we've ever had.

None of that means anything. It's such a low number of stars to give for such a great meal, expertly served. It means that everything else that STK allowed to happen that night negated any strong points they earned.

While waiting for a table, we were witness to such a mind-blowingly disgusting display that it prompted a very serious discussion of our group giving up our reservation altogether, going to In-N-Out Burger (no pun intended), and calling it a night.

At the table next to us was a man who had obviously called an escort service, had them send a couple of ""workers"" to meet him at STK, and the three of them gave us a floor show of french kissing, gyrating, miming fellatio and cunnilingus, and general dry-humping, that it's a miracle we could keep our steaks down. Management came over (without us even saying anything -- obviously others were bothered, too) and had terse words with the man, which culled the trio's amorous activities -- temporarily, It was only a matter of minutes until they resumed their table-side  menage-a-trois. When they finally left (like the slow fade of a Viagra commercial), our party came to a realization: we were actually *surrounded* by other couples who were very obviously the products of a ""business transaction"" as opposed to.....actual dates. Gorgeous African-American young beauty in skin-tight scuba dress un-zippered to the navel seated with nebbish nerd, to cite an example.

You bet we're in Vegas. Anything goes. And we're fully up for that. But when the conduct of certain patrons supersedes the comfort of others ponying up significant sums for their Wagyu beef, or the management at STK does not see the slippery slope of cheerfully opening their doors as a clubhouse for the sex trade, they might as well change the theme to Thai Ping-Pong Bar and be done with it. (or -- as it was suggested by some in the party -- change the name to ""STD""?)  Hepatitis (or worse?)  on the forks is a legitimate but secondary concern:  how about the group of us simply wanting to enjoy a glorious steak at midnight served by a wait staff who really knows their stuff without having to be witness to a Hustler Letter to the Editor in the making?

Pros:
If you instagram with #unmistkable you get a free glass of champy
The bok choy is to die for

Cons:
5 of the 7 steaks that we ordered came out under or over done. 5! I expect this at Outback Steakhouse...not STK where I am paying $50 for a steak. Management was very quick to send them back to the kitchen, and while everyone was pleased with how theirs came back, mine was still overdone. I didn't want to hold up the group even longer (we were dining pre-concert) so I just ate it as-is.

That being said, management was very good about providing us with new sides (so they were warm when our new steaks came out), free dessert and a % off the bill. Much appreciated for sure. It was just a disappointment that we had to experience that in the first place, when we were out for a big night. I can understand MAYBE getting 1 out of the 7 messed up.......but 5?

The side dishes- mac n cheese and creamed spinach were ok. The mushroom pot pie was pretty good. The feedback from the rest of the group was that the less expensive plates were pretty good.

It was true and I did feel bad for her - that's too many tables! 

Moving on...the food was fantastic.

I think that our entire group was sold from the minute that we sat down. the place was hoppin.  The environment was like a party without any sort of craziness.  
As for the food, I had the wedge salad.  It had huge chunks of bleu cheese and bacon along with these funky pickled tomatoes.  It was really good.   I then went with the 16oz sirloin with shitake mushrooms on top.  I love red meat and this thing was massive!!  I felt like John Candy in ""Great Outdoors"" eating the Ole '96er.  Although I didnt finish the steak, i enjoyed every single bite.
As for the sides...we went with the truffle fries, mac/cheese, yukon potatoes and the sweet corn pudding.  I would have licked the bowl of the pudding, if allowed. Man, it was good.
After dinner, everyone was stuffed until Teddy introduced dessert.  Ok, get this...Sweet Potato doughnuts with maple glaze and crumbled walnuts.  I'm a foodie, and these were the most ridiculously good doughnuts we all ever had.  
Our bill for 8 with wine and cocktails AND gratuity came out to about $100 a person.  To me, that's a splurge but my wife and I would spend it again in a minute.

ch458,9/22/2014,revch1051,5,"I realize that STK is some hyper-cool, vowel-free play on the word ""steak"", but I also hoped that it might also be an acronym for something.  Perhaps ""Sexy Trendy K____"", but I couldn't think of an appropriate K-word.  Oh well.

Linguistics aside, STK is a rad place for dinner.  Located in the P3 restaurant zone of the Cosmopolitan Hotel, STK is nothing like your typical, stuffy, smoke-filled Vegas steakhouse.  At STK, ultramodern decor, Ed Hardy button-down shirts, sky-high hooker heels, free-flowing cocktails, and loud electronic music rule the day.  I would expect no less at the Cosmo.

I had my first STK experience when I met some friends for dinner at the bar on a Friday night.  The place was packed solid, but it was mostly groups waiting for tables in the dining room, leaving the bar empty.  (Side note: The bar is all curvy and gorgeous, but it comes at the expense of leg room.  Tall people beware.)

I ordered a delicious Pinot Grigio (thanks for the heavy pour!) and noshed on the free bread (loved the blue cheese butter and chive olive oil!) while browsing the menu.  There are lots of traditional steakhouse items, but plenty of fish and vegetarian options make STK a good option for any sort of diner.  Our group ordered a bunch of different items, which was ideal for sampling and tasting:

** Foie gras and waffles.  This appetizer was absolutely **amazing**.  Easily the best foie preparation I've ever had (but, admittedly, I haven't tried all that many).  Loved the sear on the foie, and how the sweet huckeberry gastrique cut through the savory foie.  The waffles were crispy and light as air, too.

** Beet salad.  Simple, but outstanding.  The beets were perfectly cooked and had a nice sweetness.  Plenty of goat cheese and pistachio pesto, too.

** 7 oz filet.  Admittedly, I'm not much of a steak guy -- but this filet was out of this world.  Its texture was like butter, and it had amazing flavor.  (More hardcore carnivores may probably opt for a larger cut, but 7 oz was just right for me.)  

** Broccolini.  An ideal side dish, since it was excellently cooked, and provided a nice crunch to contrast with the filet.

** Sweet potato donuts.  You might not think of STK as a dessert destination, but these divine donuts might change your mind.  Sweet potato made for an unusual twist on a conventional donut, and a gooey and decadent pecan glaze brought it all together.  Heaven!

Service was outstanding.  Pretty much everyone on the staff looks like a model, with sex appeal dripping out of every pore -- but don't expect ""Vanderpump Rules""-style drama or catty behavior.  Quite the contrary -- the staff at STK are 100% professional and courteous, and quite friendly.  The pacing of the dishes was nice and steady, and we were never felt rushed or pressured to leave, even as we lingered over glasses of wine for maybe ~30 min after we had paid our tab.

Obviously a meal this fantastic isn't cheap, but it was worth it, since we weren't hitting places like this every night.  We were able to score a prime table (thanks to my friend) and was immediately greeted.  We chose a nice bottle of wine, and off we went.  Everyone at the table ordered a petite filet, which was the perfect amount for a girl.  I've heard rave reviews about the bone in rib eye, but with all the sides we ordered, I just couldn't.  We also ordered the asparagus, creamed corn and mac and cheese with truffle and lobster.   The mac and cheese was the real star, absolutely mouth watering, and served in a cast iron skillet.  Coming from the South, this mac and cheese is in my top 3 easily.  Creamed corn was also very very tasty.  Service was outstanding, as I never wanted for anything.  Also, what I really liked about STK was the music.  This is the only restaurant I've ever experienced that I didn't know if I should eat or dance.  The DJ that was spinning was really really great.  STK is packed full of beautiful people just like the Cosmopolitan, so with the great food, great wine, kicking music and eye candy, your dining experience is complete!",positive
ch458,9/4/2014,revch1059,5,"Oh how I love thee. This is one of my favorite steak places in Las Vegas. You really can't beat the atmosphere and the food. It is a little tough to get into, so plan ahead and call for reservations. My meal was fairly basic - filet, salad and truffle mac-n-cheese. Although the selection was basic, the food was outstanding. We also had great service and again . . . the restaurant has a really good ambiance!!!",positive
ch458,9/4/2014,revch1060,3,"Came here for a bachelorette dinner. I was starving so, it tasted GOOD but it wasn't that good. I guess I expected more in every sense. The service was average and that's being nice. The food was average, as well. 


Foie gras and waffles - Meh.

Filet - OK, a little cold. 

Potatoes - tasted like flour. Very starchy. Not good.

Mac n cheese - average.

Creamed corn - probably my favorite part. 

We had another side but I don't even remember it (that says something).

Come to think of it, maybe, the bread was my favorite part. Although, when I asked our server if there was bread coming out she snapped at me. I WAS HUNGRY, GEEZ!
I was disappointed so we skipped dessert :(

I would suggest CUT instead.",negative
ch458,9/4/2014,revch1061,5,We got a private room and was able to control the music level. Food was amazing and we all love our drinks. Must try!!!!,positive
ch458,9/2/2014,revch1062,4,Elizabeth and Matt nice have made our 2 visits amazing.  We came in a month ago no reservation and sat the bar.  It was the best decision we have ever made.  We went with an old fashioned and cocktail for my gf... They were on point!  Dinner we had a wedge salad the candied tomato balances the richness of the blue cheese it was awesome.  Filet was cooked to perfection. Sides Mac n cheese and soy glazed haricot vert were perfect.  But I must say the dessert sweet potato doughnuts will blow you mind... Both visits we made here were a 5 but I know that yelp deletes 5* reviews so I gave a 4!  We will be back stk is not pretentious or boring like other steak houses it is the perfect place for us,positive
ch458,9/1/2014,revch1063,4,"3.5ish! We came here for my boyfriend's birthday dinner. If you like being wined and dined, this is not that place. It's more like a pre-party restaurant. It's really dark inside, kind of like a club -- which includes the choice/volume of the music. Service was really nice, although there were some servers who thought they were entertainers and clapped in my ears really loudly to the beat of the music every time they passed by.

The food was great! Nothing to complain about if you like a nice steak. But for the price, I think there is better food/service/atmosphere in Vegas. It really depends on what you're in the mood for!",positive
ch458,8/30/2014,revch1064,5,"Amazing! We went here with a bachelorette party and the entire party is now raving about this steakhouse. We made reservations about a month prior and when we arrived at 7:30 for our dinner we were seated within five minutes. 

Our waiter Mags seriously made the experience so great. He had the best people skills and kept us thoroughly entertained. 

Now for the food- we all ordered steaks that were cooked perfectly; mine in particular with the red wine sauce which was fantastic. We ordered a few sides to share and wish we would of realized how big the sides actually were .  Definitely not necessary for everyone to order their own side! 

Overall I'd highly recommend this spot! The music is bumping good ol hip hop jams and the vibe is just so fun in there!",positive
ch458,8/27/2014,revch1065,5,"I've found my new favorite steakhouse in Vegas!  

I made reservations way in advance for a friend's bachelorette party.  We came on a Saturday night at 7:30pm, and were seated pretty quickly.  Our servers were awesome!  Everyone was super nice!  I had bought a round of shots for the table, and our server came back with a 2nd round on him!  

All of us ordered some form of steak, and we thoroughly enjoyed every last bite.  I topped my fillet with foie gras and it was heaven!  I'm still very upset that CA banned it!  We ordered sides to share: creamed spinahc, parmesan truffle fries, mac & cheese, mushroom pot pie and the special trio of mac & cheese.  Oh, and I can't forget about their bread!  It was topped with melted blue cheese, and we ate it all!  Either we're a bunch of pigs or all the food was delicious because there was nothing left.

Another reason we loved the restaurant was the music.  The DJ was spinning hip hop and he had us dancing in our seats.  Even the table next to us was having a great time and danced as they got up to walk around!  It does get pretty loud in the restaurant, so don't go there expecting to have a quiet, romantic dinner. 

The only one bad thing I could even think of for STK was the single stall for the bathrooms.  Not very convenient.  But everything else was superb!",positive
ch458,8/27/2014,revch1066,5,"I've been to this STK at least 4 times and they always deliver a great experience!  Compared to the one in Los Angeles, the Vegas STK seems to win in every category.  For starters, the décor is very sleek and modern but still intimate and perfect for any occasion.  We started at the bar and ordered a cocktail before getting seated.  There were 8 of us so there wasn't much room considering this is more of a sit down restaurant versus a bar to hang at.  Shortly after our drinks arrived we were sat in the upper booths but still had a perfect view of the whole restaurant.  As usually the wait staff is immediately on top of things and comes by to introduce themselves and talk about the specials.  We ordered another round of drinks as well as a few bottles of wine to go with our much anticipated steaks!  This is a very high end restaurant so you need to expect to spend some cash; however I wasn't thoroughly impressed with what they delivered for wines in the $100-$200 price range.  It's more our fault since we were looking to save a few bucks since we just spent nearly $10K in bottle service over the last couple days.  Anyway, for a starter we all ordered the tuna tartar and I must say it's probably the best out there.  That is a seriously bold statement coming from a guy who lives in LA and has sushi joints at nearly every corner.  But seriously this is beyond delicious!   The tuna was very fresh and of the highest quality.  It wasn't a huge portion but they served it on some sort of a candied wonton cripes and dressed it with oil and an avocado sauce.  The mixture of the avocado and sweetness of the wonton was unbelievable when eaten with the tuna.  Also, by adding the sugar to the wonton it kept the shell together so it didn't fall apart like most in tartar dishes.  Next came the steaks and the sides and as always the meat was of the highest quality.  Although everything was amazingly delicious, I did learn one valuable lesson about steaks.  Since we were on our way to another club I didn't want to over stuff myself so I ordered the petite filet; a couple of the other guys ordered the medium size or larger.  We ordered them medium rare but I noticed mine was cooked more through than the others.  The lesson is, always go with the larger even if you don't plan on eating it so the center can stay cooler while charring the outside.  Anyway, it was still very good but just a small thing to point out.  A few of the other guys went with the porter house and it was just perfect.  For sides we had the mash potatoes, mac and cheese, cream spinach and some garlic potato wedges.  For me the mac and cheese was just beyond amazing!  Crispy on the outer edge and creamy on the inside.  The spinach and the potatoes were a little under salted for me but I think they do it so you catch more of the steaks flavor versus having too rich of a side.  To finish things off we all ordered a double espresso, a lemon cello and a couple chocolate peanut butter bars.    The whole experience was extremely top notch from start to finish and that is why I go to STK every time I'm in Vegas.",positive
ch458,8/25/2014,revch1067,4,"I've been to Vegas again since eating at STK and honestly it's all I thought about the whole time. Since Vegas has so many options, I hate going to the same place twice. I have this guilty feeling that I'm missing out on something, however this time around, I'm genuinely pissed at myself.  STK is perfect for a late meal before clubbing, or for a lively group of people that don't mind eating dinner in a loud atmosphere. We walk in and the place was jamming. They had a DJ spinning AWESOME 90's R&B and Rap and all the servers were on their A game. The food was fresh, delicious and came out promptly - but not so fast where you think it's not being cooked for you. 
The coolest part about STK is going to the kitchen and seeing the chef's line with their amazing view. The chefs are having just as much fun as all of the guests. I'd highly recommend STK and will absolutely be visiting my next time in Vegas.",positive
ch458,8/25/2014,revch1068,5,"I honestly do not understand the negative reviews. if you are looking to have a quiet and boring dinner experience then I'm not sure what you are doing in Las Vegas and this restaurant is definitely not for you.
We had an amazing time the food and service was incredible. Eddy was our server and he was so awesome! So energetic, fun and knowledgeable. We started with the shellfish platter the flavor of all the seafood was all so good, so fresh so succulent mmmm... this honestly was so filling it would have satisfied us for dinner. Did we stop there though? Nope! next we got the Wagyu, I have never had Wagyu before and OMG!!! Now I know what I have been missing it was incredible!  It literally melts in your mouth! Honestly if you have an opportunity to order this, do it! You deserve to treat yourself! We all ordered a steak as well I got the 10 oz filet, medium rare with king crab Oscar topping. The steak was cooked so perfectly it honestly did not need the topping but the crab was very delish as well. All of our steaks were so perfect we all like medium rare but my brother in law ordered a bone in and Eddy our server suggested he ordered medium due to the bone it would come out a little more on the rare side if he were to go with medium rare. Eddy was on point with his suggestion. We also got the creamy Yukon potatoes, green beans and sweet corn pudding. We were so full with all the food and wine we were consuming! But we were having a blast and kept moving our bodies because the atmosphere was so fun they were playing the jams! A mix of 80's 90's and 00's, I have seen complaints of the noise level of the music and honestly I could hear what everyone in my table was saying and even our server.
Okay so we are singing along to our fave songs dancing while our plates are being removed from our table and we are so in the moment I did not notice they were laying out small plates in front of us we had a confused look on our face, what Is this for? And then Eddy brings out 2 shots for each of us and then they bring out desserts!! Omg!! Donuts with this glaze, whip cream and pecans! And a Panna cotta with strawberry topping! I think we all said at the same time ""Eddy! What are you doing to us!!"" Lol, We were so full how are we going to eat this! Well those 2 shots that were brought out,I am not sure what the first was I just drank it and the second was ginger beer, Eddy said this would help make us feel less full or something to that effect I had a lot of wine by now :) it must have worked because we dug right into the desert which was so incredible it was like a party in my mouth. 

Our whole time there we just were amazed with each bite, each sip, each song and each encounter we had with Eddy. We were headed to the club later that night so we had to run but I honestly did not want to leave and I had so much more fun at STK then I did at the night club. Thank you so much Eddy and STK for the amazing experience!!!!",positive

ch458,8/23/2014,revch1071,4,"My friends and I came here for a bachelorette party of six. I ordered the 10 oz filet (cooked perfectly, just the way I wanted, medium and juicy) and Parmesan truffle fries (the best truffle fries I've tasted and cut thick, just the way I love my fries cut). They also bring out a small pot of bread for each person, which was tasty and cute. Service was very good and the waitress even bought us a round of shots because it was a bachelorette party, plus I think she thought the group was a bit too quiet for what we were celebrating lol. I would love to come here again and try the other steaks and entrees.

Tip: If you're driving here, park in the East garage because it'll be a shorter walk to the restaurant.",positive
ch458,8/21/2014,revch1072,1,It was alright. Had the lobster ravioli and flank steak. Honestly I can make a better ravioli than that hands down. And well the skirt steak. I'd had way better in Carne asada burritos. It is what it is. A glamorized steak house in vegas.,negative
ch458,8/21/2014,revch1073,2,"I'm generally not a steak person.  I have been to some nice steakhouses but I just can't manage to really get into it.  As such, STK was never high on my list of places to eat in Vegas.  I ended up going for a business dinner and was generally pleased, even for my steak-averse palate.

Pros
*The appetizers were amazing.  Hands down.  Everything we ordered was fantastic and they actually gave us the appropriate number of items based on the people at the table (might have been coincidence but I'll give them the point)
*The music selection was late 90's and early 2000's that reminded me of days gone by.  It was not what you normally hear at a club or a restaurant so it was a fun change of pace
*The drinks were fantastic and we were always asked about a fresh one before our glasses were empty
*The steak!  I know!  I said it.  It was a pretty good steak.  I only had a few bites of someone else's but it was the complete opposite of where my mind goes when I think about steak.

So far this review has been high-fives and kudos.  But that two star rating up there, that wasn't a mistake.  Every cloud has its silver lining, and at STK there were plenty of dark clouds to go with those small positive notes.

Cons
*The volume of the music is insane.  It started out manageable but we were basically shouting at each other by the time we left
*The drink I ordered was $18, and that seemed to be about average
*The sides were hit or miss.  Asparagus was cold but the truffle fries were like pillows of potatoey goodness.  The gratin was basically raw potatoes but the mushroom pot pie was flavorful, hot, and exotic tasting
*The service.  Our waiter was great.  Friendly, outgoing, ready to make recommendations.  Unfortunately, after he took our order he was gone and never to be seen again.  Instead we ended up with a loitering busser.  

As I mentioned earlier, this was a business dinner.  We were there to eat, of course, but we were also talking and enjoying our evening.  I guess we took too long to finish our appetizers because the server asked us no less than three times if he could clear anything away.  Every time we said no and he just slipped to the side and waited there.  It was like he was counting mississippi's in his head until he could ask us again.

So we've finished our entrees.  We ordered a shared dessert and coffee.  We're winding our evening down when the manager comes over to the table.  I assumed that he was there to just say thank you since I'm sure our bill was near the $1000 mark for the evening.  Turns out he was basically kicking us out of our seat.  He said the restaurant was at capacity and he wanted to buy us a drink at the bar so we could free up the table.

I'm sure there are people in Vegas who wish that their restaurants could be so full at 8pm on a weeknight that they are at capacity, but I can't tolerate being rushed from our table just because other people want to sit down.  I've waited at restaurants for over an hour because people weren't getting up and leaving, and that's just the way it goes.  If you dont like the wait time you go elsewhere.  It was really poor form that the manager asked us to vacate the table (after the check had been paid, mind you).

Overall I am disappointed with STK.  I went into the experience expecting stellar service and mediocre food.  Turns out the food was the surprise winner and the service was just leaving much to be desired.",negative
ch458,8/20/2014,revch1074,5,"Just recently visited this establishment for a Bachelor Party Dinner in the beginning of August. 

The food was delicious, service was superb and atmosphere was energetic! I had the 13oz Skirt Steak with bacon butter which I highly recommended. Others in my group order filets and bone in rib eyes and all were more than satisfied with their meals. For dessert I would encourage you to save room, so that you can sample the deliciousness of the sweet potato doughnuts! They were out of this world good! 

So if your in the dessert and have some money left over from the tables definitely try STK at the Cosmo I doubt you'll be disappointed!",positive

ch458,8/10/2014,revch1077,4,"Food and service were overall, great.  This place is good for groups but maybe not kids.  The music was a bit loud but they were playing all the old hits so it was like fine dining in a club.  Even the bathroom had a staff person who offered all the toiletries and then some.  There was a line for the bathrooms, only one per gender.  Luckily there were more stalls outside of the restaurant.

The steaks were tender and cooked the way we ordered them.  The dipping sauces were a nice addition.  All of the side dishes were great to share and they had a good variety.  The mac n cheese sampler was probably my fav.  If you're coming here to celebrate a special occasion, be sure to let your server know and they will end your meal with a special treat.  We got a cup of fruit with a light whipped cream topped with a macaroon.  It was definitely a nice, happy ending.

Drinks are a bit pricy here.  We ordered 3 mixed drinks while we waited for our table and that bill alone came out to $60.  I'd definitely eat here again but maybe after some pre-drinking elsewhere.",positive

The atmosphere is classy cool.  When we sat down my husband and I ordered a half dozen oysters.  They were small but very fresh and delicious.  We split the porterhouse steak that was cooked and seasoned to perfection and had asparagus and lobster Mac and cheese that was fabulous but a little pricey.

ch458,8/5/2014,revch1083,2,"Disappointed with our experience here. Service was outstanding, but that's about all I can say for this location of STK. Visiting Vegas for the week from NYC where I have had great experiences at their midtown NYC location. This restaurant had sub-par food, steaks, sides and overall prices really didn't justify the costs. 

Coming from someone who lives in NYC, I'm not one to complain about things that cost more than usual, it's just that when our steaks came, they weren't rich and flavorful like they tasted at the other location. I asked my three other dinner companions and they all agreed whole-heartedly that it was a pretty big disappointment.

My last comment is on the restaurant itself. Compared to other locations, it seems like they really didn't invest much to pump the ambience, it's lit up bright.",negative

- Nice Decor
- good steaks

Weaknesses:
- No the warmest welcome for high end restaurant by the hostesses

- Not a very attentive staff - asked for ""easy on parmesan for the fries"" and got them completely covered
- Waiting time to get the food - was 45mins for 3 steaks... We were about to leave.
- Tiny bathroom! long waiting line for ladies and men!

The bread was hot and delicious and our steaks were cooked to perfection. I was adventurous and ordered the jalapeño onion topper on top of my filet and enjoyed every bite.  Mac was cheesy and the asparagus had a nice kick of zest.
The music was great and brought back memories of years past.  Props to the DJ for his mash-ups.

The group I was with has been there several times over the past few years--enough where the staff recognizes us.   On this past visit, the food was excellent (as always), the bartenders/host staff were great (as always), but the problem?  The DJ.  The Thursday night DJ fell short for us.  The Friday/Saturday night DJ always plays everything you want to hear and always leaves you wondering, ""Did he steal my playlist?""    The Thursday night DJ needed a little help.  We handed her a list of 4 songs with a nice tip.  The first two requests said, ""Anything Britney and anything Michael.""  Not to needy, right?  In the two hours we were there, we only heard 2 of 4 requests and with the second one we had to beg.  (And I mean seriously beg).  We were sweet and nice and completely reasonable, leaving a 25% tip for our servers (we had to ask them to beg too).  Note to the Thursday night DJ:  when one of your patrons has the entire upper floor clapping and cheering to her dance routines, play what she wants to hear because it's not about you.

Delicious food
Wonderful service

When I go on yelp I want to know what people ordered and if it was palatable. 
So I'll start with the best dish!!!
The sweet potato donuts are AMAZING!
I'm going to try not to sneak back down later this evening for my very own plate :) make sure you save room for those. Or start with them. Might as well insure you have room.
For dinner...
We ordered the filet rare. It was tender and delicious. 
The fish of the day was sea bass and it was buttery with a crispy outer layer. Amazing!
We ordered 4 sides
The creamed corn, my husband said it was his favorite. It was a little more like a soufflé in my opinion. Good taste, sweet but a little fluffy, not like southern creamed corn.
Mashed potatoes- Creamy and delicious.
Macaroni and cheese- Flavorful.
Broccolini- tasty.
The other dessert we had was the pana cotta. Hmmm, not great, sadly. 

The sides were good. Not to die for but yummy. Usually the sides have me oohing and awing. The main courses were very yummy. 
This was probably my 2nd time here in Vegas and we probably dine at the LA location yearly. So I'm sure we will be back. 
It's a great restaurant for special occasions. I love the atmosphere, very fun.

ch458,7/13/2014,revch1093,4,"Ok bachelorette party night #2, we went to STK. This was much more fun than the prior evening. Partly because the restaurant was located in the convenience of our hotel, the Cosmo. Atmosphere was tame, noone was obviously drunk or falling out of their seat. The night was off to a good start. All of the waitstaff were gorgeous, including our busboy, who got shamelessly hit on by several of the girls at our table. No not me. I was focused on the food, which was amazing. Our server was prompt with our drink orders and complimentary bread for the table (out of this world good!) It had chive butter melted on the side. I ate so much I was not too hungry so only ordered the tuna tartare appetizer and romaine salad. That was the perfect amount of food though and the tuna was awesome. The salad tasted like it had caesar dressing which I love so it was all good. Other favorite dishes at the table were the crab legs and shrimp rice crispies. If I came back I would probably stick with the tuna again but get the pear/walnut salad.",positive

We ordered a couple appetizers to share; FoieGras Waffles and Beet Salad, both were decent but nothing special. For entrées, we ordered a cowboy rib eye with attached bone. The server recommended we add FoieGras and Truffle butter to top the steak. The steak was common even with all that foie and truffle butter.

It was towards the end of our trip where we found ourselves checked out of the hotel but waiting for a later flight sooooo steak it is!

We got here too early to really get the feel of the place but it seemed to be like the NYC STK, a trendy steakhouse.

Ordered a salad and a sirloin as I've been known to do...  

Service was solid, server was nice enough and attentive without being overly good or bad in any way.  

Salad was a bit of a dissapointment, was sort of a hodpodge between a regular salad and a blue cheese wedge.  It wasn't bad but it wasn't good.

The steak was very solid though.  Ordered rare + and it came out medium rare so that was fine.  Sort of underseasoned but I was able to fix that with the ton of pepper and salt the waitress brought over.  Overall the steak was good to very good but not Del Frisco's/Sparks level.  

The sides were pretty good as well, creamed spinach was nice in particular. 

There are entirely too many options to ever head back to this place again but I would say if you're in the hotel and hungry it is a solid choice.  Boarderline 3/4 star I'll give it the bump to 4.",positive
ch458,7/4/2014,revch1096,4,"What absolutely love about this place is the upbeat atmosphere.  They have a DJ (but not too loud) who plays upbeat music to keep your energy high if you're planning on staying out afterwards.

Not necessarily a place for romance, though.

The food is pretty good and the cocktails are outstanding.  I definitely recommend topping your steak with the truffle butter.

Service was a tad slow but when our waitress was around she was knowledgable and friendly. 

You MUST try the sweet potato doughnuts for dessert!",positive
ch458,6/29/2014,revch1097,4,"So when we first arrived to Vegas my boyfriend kept saying...
Boyfriend: if I do good on the tables I'm going to take you to STK!
Me: What's that?
Boyfriend: A steakhouse. ..get it STK...steak...isn't that cool.
Me: Yes, that is so clever. Anyways it must be really expensive if you're depending on doing well on the table. 

So all week he's talking about this place and loses a good chunk of money on the table the night we were supposed to go. Well I played my $10 ( im afraid to gamble), and walked away with $50! I said, ""Well it looks like I'm buying myself dinner at STK, you're not going to talk about it all week and not let me go because you're mad at your bad luck."" Lol

It was 10:30pm and before going back to our hotel we went to the 3rd floor of Cosmo to check out STK. We heard the great music coming out of STK and they we're playing all the hip hop jams. It was the best music I heard all week ( esp since it was EDC WEEK). The hostess said they could reserve a table for 11:00pm, so we hung around since the music was good.

Atmosphere- Def looks like where all the trendy people go, Cosmo feels like that anyways. All the women were beautiful, the men dressed nice. There were a lot people hanging around the bar. Restaurant dark and music loud. 

So around 11:10 we were seated and our server was pretty cool. We looked at the menu and I studied what I could get with my $50 winnings. I only went here to spend my winnings as planned.  Well after looking at the menu I saw I could get salad, dessert and maybe water for $50 lol. Most steak dishes were around $50 minimum, chicken dish around $30, all desserts $12, sides $11, side salad $13, and most appetizers and small plates close to $20. Cocktail/Drinks $15 to $30.

After some quick calculations I ordered a field green salad, an appetizer, and the sweet potato donuts. I saw that shrimp was $6 so I said,""Can I add shrimp to my salad?"" The server then asked, how many pieces? I said,""How many come in the $6 order?"" He said...one piece. I was like, 1 piece? What kind of prep goes into that shrimp, $36 for 6 pieces? Ok nevermind adding shrimp. The server then kept asking if I wanted a cocktail, and in my head I was like ,""hell no"", keep the free water coming lol.

The blue cheese bread with chives was a little too strong for me, I'm not a fan of it.  My salad was ok, better than a lot of places but it needed craisins or nuts or shrimp lol...something.  My beef appetizer dish with pesto pasta was light and tasty.  The beef was sliced so thin it melted in my mouth. The sweet potato donuts were sooooo good. Definitely try those.  Sweet and fried fresh. 

My poor boyfriend still had the poop face about losing $400 in 10 min, and he didn't want to try anything. He was at least trying to get into the music to feel better. A girl next to me was there for her birthday and her boyfriend ordered her every dessert on the menu. They all looked so good! Especially the skillet cookie. She actually offered me some, but I heard my boyfriend jokingly whisper...""if you say yes and take some of her food, im gonna slap you."" So I told her,  no thank you.

My bill came to $49 without an entree, but I was still satisfied.  I'll def come back for the full experience when we have more time and money ;).",positive
ch458,6/27/2014,revch1098,5,"We were staying at the Cosmopolitan and wanted to eat at STK before a night out. We tried to make reservations earlier in the day but were told they had nothing available but were welcome to stop-by to see if anything had opened up.

We arrived and almost immediately, they found a spot for our party of 4. It is definitely a lively spot. We were dining late (around 9pm) and the music was loud, the place was packed and everyone was having a great time.

We all ordered steaks, and they were wonderful. I order my steak well-done, and most steak houses will still bring it with some pink in the middle. STK cooked it to perfection, just how I asked. My husband and his friend both said it was the best steak either of them had ever had.

The creamy yukon potatoes were amazing as well.

Great experience, will definitely be back!",positive
ch458,6/27/2014,revch1099,3,Good food. But way too loud.  It's a good restaurant with loud club music. Not the place to go if you want to have a conversation.,negative
ch458,6/24/2014,revch1100,4,"Rounded up from 3.5 stars, another stop during EDC weekend. I live in LA and I haven't been to STK in LA. Blasphemous right? 

Ordered their special of the night: Chilean Sea Bass (on a bed of porcini mushrooms and topped with shaved black truffle): So tasty! The Chilean sea bass was perfectly cooked and the bed of mushrooms were DELICIOUS. However, because of how flavorful the porcini was, the delicate truffle was lost. However, I was amazed by the sheer quantity of truffle. This dish was swimming in it. 

No meal is complete without sides:
*Mac & Cheese: I'm not sure what kind of cheese they use but it was more white/mild? Eh. Skip it. 
*Sweet Corn Pudding: People rave about this and I can see why. It's sweet, creamy and kind of like mashed potatoes! Probably not any healthier than mashed potatoes but still tasty
*Haricot Vert: Pretty standard but gotta get your greens in! 
*Broccolini: Super salty.

ch458,6/24/2014,revch1101,3,"My party of 4 came here for dinner and was greeted by great service. Our server was friendly, and attended to our food complaints professionally.

Bread with blue cheese sauce and chive olive oil - This was rather adventurous and I really enjoyed it since I'm a fan of blue cheese. Unfortunately, my friends didnt enjoy it quite as much :( To each its own!

Beef tartare with black truffle, sliced radish, soy caramel - Love how the fragrance of the black truffle brought out the freshness of the beef. The potato chip was also very fresh. Really enjoyed this.

Pork belly with soy glaze, pickled radish and ginger - The first time this was served, the pork belly was over cooked so much that it was tough and chewy. Not great. Had to send this back. The second time was much better and more well seasoned, though still a little too tough for my liking. I'd give this a pass.

Lil BRGs (wagyu sliders) - Super good!! We didnt add truffles or foie gras, but if I had the chance to do this again, I'd definitely try adding both!

Medium Sirloin steak - The best steak of the night. Steak was beautifully cooked, soft, easily cut, and had a layer of fats making the steak not too dry. Definitely recommended.

Medium filet with foie gras topping - Steak was slightly too dry for my liking, but foie gras was beautifully cooked. 

Medium Rare Filet Medallion - The first time this was served, the beef was way overcooked. It was so cooked that it tasted overly-charred, and the beef was definitely past medium rare. We had this sent back and the beef was perfectly cooked the second time round. Recommended!

Sides:
Mushroom pot pie - This was yummy, but way too salty. There is no way the pot pie can be this salty. We contemplated sending this back too, but by then have given up on having our food sent back so we just ate it anyway.

Truffle fries - OMG SO GOOD. MUST ORDER. Freshly cut potato with truffles. Can't go wrong.

Mac and cheese - Decent but ok to pass.

The bill came up to be about $330 before tips, including a bottle of riesling, which is pretty OK. Ambience was nice with great music. 

4 stars for food (after they finally got it right), but unfortunately having to send food back twice is unacceptable for a fine dining restaurant, hence -1 star. Thankfully, the waiter handled it professionally and made sure we were very satisfied with our food.",negative
ch458,6/13/2014,revch1102,4,"Solid steak place. I got the bone-in ribeye and split it with someone. We also got mushrooms and broccoli rabe as sides. Oh, and a tuna tartare to start. Everything was delicious, server did a great job handling 10 girls. The food even came out in good time considering the place was packed. 

My only complaint is you can barely hear yourself speak because it's so damn loud in there, it's like a club.",positive

Stephanie and Amy just plain kick -ass over the competition. Genuinely friendly, beautiful, great at what they do, it makes suffering through the 150 decibal sound system all worth it. And Shady has to admit, with all the scenery the food is actually very good. This year Shady took down the lamb chops which were cooked perfectly and delicious on one night, and the sirlion on another. Coupled with some nice red's, the great girls behind the bar, and the scenery all around, STK is just a great night out in Vegas. Shady has been a regular here since it opened 3 years ago, and as long as Shady's ladies are there, so is Shady.

ch458,6/9/2014,revch1105,5,"We tried to reserve a table of 4 on a Friday night on the night before. Everything was completely booked except for tables at around 5pm and 11pm. Those times were just too early and too late. We passed by the place around 4 and tried to bribe our way to get a table around 7 and the hostess told us that there was a section (the tall tables) that are first come first serve and they usually fill up by 7. So, we left and two of us came back at about 6:20pm and got a table easily. Out of about 12 or so, after us, there were only 2 tables left and they filled up in 10 min...so if you can't reserve a table, arrive around 6 to get a tall table!

Service was great all night by the busser and waitress. Cleared dirty dishes out quickly and checked on us often. We did bring a bottle of wine ourselves and was told that there was a $50 corkage fee. My friend complained to the waitress saying it was BS to charge that much to open a bottle and politely asked if she could ask her manager to not charge him (since he was a Cosmo VIP guest) or at least reduce the fee. The manager reduced it to $25.

Atmosphere was cool, they have a live DJ playing and he was spinning 80's music the whole time, that was dope. Definitely an upscale resto. They say you're supposed to dress formal/""nice"" but I came in jean booty shorts, a cropped top and black flats. Other girls were dressed like they were going to a winter formal. 

We started off with a dozen of half shell oysters, they were pretty small. Ordered the mac and cheese, it was alright (not a huge mac and cheese fan but the others loved it). Ordered the truffle parmesan fries, these were thicker fries than I thought but they were really good! And for my entree, I ordered the porterhouse to share with my friend because it was such a huge dish. Also got the red wine bbq? sauce on the side, and omg, it was sooooooooo good!! I dipped everything in that sauce! haha. Also ordered the stiletto cucumber cocktail, it's pretty minty, it was good. Friends ordered the chocolate cocktail, not a huge fan of chocolate..but if you're a chocolate lover, this one's for youu!

Overall, everything was great! Great service, great food, great atmosphere! Would def come back! Bill came out to about $400, yes very pricey. The best part of it all, the whole meal was comp'd. #WIN.",positive
ch458,6/7/2014,revch1106,4,"It is a niiiice place for a romantic dinner, I personally loved the dimmed light atmosphere. I was recommended the Kobe steak, which I thought was not any better than their rib-eye. So you can save your money on that! I love their oyster!! Super fresh!! Not a fan of their pie.",positive
ch458,6/3/2014,revch1107,5,"I've eaten at countless Prime steak houses and this is by far one of the best meals I've ever had.  We had a party of 7 that included 12 years old twins.  The waitress was top notch, she even took my twins over to the DJ so they could see how things work!

Now on to the food...

Only one person ordered a salad (I forgot which one) but loved it!  I had the Lobster Cocktail which had just the right amount of kick from the horseradish and vodka.  For side dished we ordered Sweet Pudding Corn, Parmesan Truffle Fries, Mac & Cheese, and Spiced Maple Carrots.  All of which were simply amazing.  For steaks we had 4 bone in Filets (Best steak I've had in years), 2 bone-in Rib Steaks, and 1 Filet Medallion.  They were all cooked to the perfect temp, seasoned perfectly, and served piping hot.  

For dessert they had an off the menu item which we tries which has a homemade mint chocolate chip sandwich served with homemade whipped cream and chocolate sauce for dipping.  The homemade mint ice cream was the star of the show.  I've never had ice cream before with such a great flavor of mint!  We also ordered the STK Cones which were good but nothing like the ice cream sandwich.

It's not cheap ($750 with tax and tip and we only had about 6 beers total) but worth it!",positive
ch458,6/3/2014,revch1108,5,"Arrived around 8pm and there was a at least 20 people in line reserving a table for their individual parties.  Some dressed to the nines and other in shorts and T-Shirts.  STK may not have a formal dress code but the ambiance deserves the common courtesy of looking presentable at the very minimum.  I of course decided on my blue pin striped suit with colorful pocket square to add that bit of splash. 

I went past the line and straight for the bar since you have access to their full menu. They have two bars here. If the first one is full continue towards the back and you will most likely find an open seat.  The bar tenders were absolute dolls and very attentive, making you feel at home.  With the DJ spinning tracks in the background and with dim lighting, it sets you up for an evening out on the town. 

First came out the bread which gets mad reviews from Yelpers across the board. I thought the hype was over the top, turns out it live up to it and plus more. 

I started my dinner with a field greens salad which I didn't expect much other than a common mixed greens salad.  It was amazing and definitely worth a try if you liked feta cheese. Beside the vinaigrette which was full flavored it had candied pecans which were succulent.

On to the main course, their Colorado Rack of Lamb. Ordered it medium rare as any respective lamb lover should.  It was seasoned to perfection and sinfully marbled. You are almost forced to gnaw on the bone and since I was at the end of the bar counter, I couldn't help myself and sneaked in a couple of nibbles. It was simply that good. 

For desert, on recommendation the of the lovely bar tender, I went with the sweat potato donuts with caramelized walnuts. Mind you I hate anything sweet potato but after being referred to as honey, sweetie and babe the whole night I couldn't refuse the recommendation.

I'm glad I did because it was epic and in the top three deserts i have ever had in Vegas. I paired it with a latte and it was to die for. A definite must have.",positive
ch458,6/2/2014,revch1109,1,"This rating is specifically for the planned course for our bachelorette party. 13 women, $2200, $170 per person. Many times people give bad reviews because a place is expensive. I didn't come to Vegas to save money, so that is not my gripe. The majority of us were doctors, lawyers, and those in the medical profession. We came here to throw down :) I am actually so surprised that the food was this bad. Just because our service came ""family style"" doesn't mean they should skimp on portions or quality (ask Robert Irvine on Dinner Impossible). This is what we all got for $2200, and I'm NOT kidding!: 

1. Bread (was the best thing I had here)
2. Soggy overdressed ceaser salad
3. ONE cocktail shrimp (ONE!!!! not a few, not several, but ONE!!!)
4. ONE lobster ravioli (ONE!!!, the size of a regular ravioli, 2 x 2). I didn't eat this one because I am allergic to lobster, so I gave mine to my friend. So she had TWO.
5. One small lump Mac and cheese (Not the good kind with the real cheese and baked crust on top, the kind you would get at a buffet)
6. One lump Creamed spinach. No real comments, it's creamed spinach.
7. Risotto swimming in what tasted like Campbells cream of chicken soup.
8. And the star of the night, the main course...dry skirt steak, not seasoned. Good thing the bride doesn't eat beef! (A lot got thrown away, no one wanted to eat much of it)
9. One glass of champagne

6 of us got an extra cocktail (well vodka and club soda for me, very small glass, not those large tumblers you get at the club). I felt like I crashed my grandfather's assisted living buffet dinner. This food was not only extremely expensive, but it would have been a rip off even if it was a cheap meal at any old restaurant. SHAME ON YOU STK! Giving us this horrible memory of our darling friend's celebration dinner. Of course she didn't complain, she is a beautiful person. 

We were all crammed in a table that wasn't meant to fit 13, we had reservations, but we were 30 minutes late because it takes a long time for 13 women to get out of the room (Know what I mean?), but geez, hold our table for pete's sake, and don't let us wait 1 hour to sit down. They ended up bringing this table from storage and making room in the bar area for us, one hour later when they could have done this from the get go when they saw their restaurant was full. There were no serving utensils with any of our platters, so we used our forks and spoons to dish. Not clean or convenient. We were all good friends, so this is the least of my gripes. 

Did we have fun? Yes, the music was all 80s, and catered to our 30 and up crowd. We thoroughly enjoyed watching the next table of 40 and overs doing the running man and cabbage patch to tunes from Tag Team and Grand Master Flash. That part was amazing. Kept my mind off being continuously tempted to speak to the manager about his horrible meal, and that was BEFORE the bill came. The service was great, but didn't make up for the horrible horrible horrible food to warrant even a second star. I had to throw that in one more time, as I get angrier the more I write.

Will I come here again, maybe. So I can understand why people gave it such good ratings, since they most likely did not order a planned course meal. For anyone thinking of having a planned meal here for large party, or possibly pre-wedding festivities, DON'T. Order a ""normal"" meal, like normal people do. That's what we should have done.",negative
ch458,5/31/2014,revch1110,1,"Don't waste your time on this restaurant; substandard is too high of a rating for this restaurant. We sat at our table  20 minutes before we even knew who our waiter was and another 5 minutes before he came back to take our order. 
My husband's steak was over cooked, the waiter came back once to check on us, and then he never came back again until we waved him down to get our bill. The music is so loud you could hear what one another was saying, the table next to us was yelling in order to be heard by one another which was annoying. It was the worst dining experience ever!!!!
My Daughter came into town the next night not knowing we went to STK the night before, 
She went to STK, She shared this with me the next morning at coffee. Another horrible experience, she and her friend ordered all appetizers asking that they come out one after another but they brought them all at the same time and again the music was a problem way TOO LOUD!!! Her friend said I can hear anything your saying. They left never needing to return.

ch458,5/28/2014,revch1112,5,"STK never disappoints! The crowd is very trendy and the music is always bumpin. The DJ plays hip hop to house and everything in between. It sometimes gets a little noisy but the more you drink the less it bothers you. As for the steaks, I think they are some of the best I've tried; however, I find myself craving their seafood platter. It has an  ample amount of seafood in the order for one but I usually take it up a notch and get the order for two. But whether you order the steak or seafood platter just make sure you get the cream corn. It is incredible!",positive

ch458,5/26/2014,revch1114,5,Everything was superb. Steaks were cooked perfect. Tuna sashimi spicy and flavorful. Sides of bok choi and broccollini were great additions. An excellent meal only topped by the service of our waiter Mikey Tan,positive
ch458,5/18/2014,revch1115,2,"This should be a one-word review--Blaaah!  However, I'll give STK it's due. Great atmosphere with sleek chrome and black leather. The service was great but the food was lackluster. We started with salads and I had the baby beet salad which was perfectly presented and the best thing I had this evening. 

My colleague and I both ordered the 10oz filet and we shared the Yukon mashed potatoes, the Mac and cheese, and the asparagus with orange jalapeño glaze. The steaks were very tender but lacked any real flavor, they were cooked to an exact medium rare. The Yukon mashed potatoes were a bit on the soupy side and had no form. The Mac and cheese was just that. It was like they took cooked macaroni and topped it with some cheese and baked it. It was not at all creamy and rich. My colleague and I both commented that we tasted neither orange nor jalapeño in the asparagus sauce.

On a side note-I tried to go to the restroom but the line was so long that I was told to come back later. I'm not really sure if the guy who told me that worked there or he just had to go really badly.

Finally, there these three huge bouncer type guys who looked like they were in charge. As soon as the waiter brought the check I was signing when I heard one of these big mooks say to a group of four standing behind us, ""Yeah, these are your seats. I'm just waiting for these guys to get outta here."" I thought it was very rude. From sit down to exit we were there an hour and five minutes. We spent over $120 each and we only had iced tea to drink.

I'll be back in vegas next month and STK is on a list for us to consider for dining. I will strongly suggest that we spend our time and money somewhere else.",negative

ch458,5/9/2014,revch1118,2,"I dined at STK a couple years back, and I remember thinking, it was just OK. It was on my birthday and I enjoyed the company and celebration. I didn't let it bother me. When I was invited to go again, and for free, I figured, why not? 
Either I stepped up my steak game, or STK fell off even more because overall- NOTHING impressed me. Wait, I fib, the mushroom pot pie side dish was good enough to order again. So out of a dinner that would have cost $145, the best part was a side dish?!!?

My boyfriend and I ordered the gyoza, a field greens salad, the 20oz ribeye sliced, the mushroom pot pie, and a panna cotta dessert. 
First, sharing is the way to go. Other than the potstickers being extremely small, coming with only 4, and costing $19- I was happy with the portions and servings. They offered to split the salad and slice the steak, very appreciated for things like that. 
They staff was on game, they cleared our plates and gave us fresh silverware after every dish. The salad needed more of the cheese and croutons. That's what made it enjoyable. The steak was just ok. Not amazing, not bad. The bacon butter on top was super succulent. The side of mushrooms came in a classic looking pot pie crust, and when you cut into it there were about 4 types of mushrooms in a creamy sauce. It was the highlight of the night! The panna cotta, never again! Wrong consistency and just all around not enough flavor for me. 

Another downfall- one glass of wine is $17. I understand fancy steakhouses charging more for specialty cocktails, high end liquor, etc. But even then it ranges about $10-$15. $17 for a glass of mediocre wine, is pathetic. 

I get STK's concept. A sexy club feel with high end food. Except that wasn't the vibe I got. More like a cutting corners steakhouse that caters to the local adult industry, rich tourist, and old men who like the eye candy. 
Vegas needs that, don't get me wrong. I am not hating on the adult industry in the least. But when there are well known Vegas working girls that dine there on the regular, it attracts a certain crowd. You wouldn't see those same girls down the street at Herb & Rye, thank God. 

Overall, my favorite part was the DJ bumping 90's jams, and the mushrooms. I will gladly skip out on the drunk, red head tourist sitting next to me screaming, and spilling stinky wine, and the pervy old guys.

ch458,5/7/2014,revch1120,1,This review has to do with just trying to give STK business.  I've being trying to reach them for 2 days to book a private room for 12 people.   When restaurants are hot and booked every night they think they are untouchable.  This attitude/arrogance is pathetic!  They will not always be on top and when their appeal declines people will remember how they were treated.  Good Luck STK!,negative
ch458,5/6/2014,revch1121,4,"A little overpriced for the quality. The filet mignon was not as tender as anyone in my party would have liked. Also, the truffle butter as a topping for the steak was an extra $12. It's a beautiful restaurant, great and friendly service.",positive
ch458,4/29/2014,revch1122,5,"Had the pleasure of dining here last night for a friends birthday and at 8pm on a Monday the place was packed. We were greeted right away by our server, Chris, who gave us a crash course in the menu and offered a few recommendations. Chris was knowledgable and very personable, and his expert service was nothing less than exceptional.

To start, I enjoyed the beet and arugula salad which was wonderful and finished the course with their 20oz bone-in ribeye (med rare, of course) topped with bacon butter, because why would you not? Happily sampled a bit of my friends skirt steak as well which was likewise, outstanding. Oh! And a quick side note; if you're a manhattan drinker, you'll be pleased to know they carry Carpano Antica... And yes, it absolutely matters.

Anyway, I only visit Las Vegas once or twice a year but I'm pleased to say with certainty that I will be coming back to STK.

So, a quick recap?

ch458,4/24/2014,revch1124,4,"I think there is one of these in NY too. We were happy to walk in and be seated right away... it was 5pm. I guess I eat like an old person. I had the filet, asparagus and some kind of potato. Although I cannot say this is the best Filet I have had it was better than most. The 4 stars is because we got right in and my wife loves this place. .. .. 
As it got later the interestingness (made up word) of the people got better. Cougars, pimps, college kids, transients, sugar daddies. they were all here fraternizing in a friendly fashion.",positive
ch458,4/23/2014,revch1125,5,"STK is such a fun, hip, really most happening place in Vegas. I will come back here times and times again, since it's become one of my fav. Stopped by here for dinner last week when in LV! Every time this place is consistently EXCELLENT!
DRINKS: Decided on Cucumber Stiletto and OMG - it is incredible! 
FOOD: Started with the signature bread rolls (you just can't stop eating them!), then had tuna tartar - really fresh tuna with delicate spice to it, awesome presentation. Then had pork belly and WOW - so good!! My choice of the meal was beet salad and beef carpaccio (both dishes are a MUST TRY!!!). Food arrived within minutes and service was fantastic. Can't wait to come back!",positive
ch458,4/20/2014,revch1126,4,"The truffle-parmesan fries themselves are worth coming here for. Oh. My. God!
There are not many fries on the little skillet they're served on, but they sure are tasty.

The meat is good but perhaps not top-notch. I had some gristle in my sirloin that my knife was not capable of cutting through! That is not what I expect from a piece of meat that cost me $50...

Everything else was great though - the service was impeccable, our waiter was just the right amount of chatty and made sure everything arrived in time and that our water-glasses was never below half empty.

We had a really good time here and I'll definitely stop by again.

Downside is if you arrive late - a DJ will be pumping dance music at a volume high enough to compete with any club... So, if you actually want to talk to your date/comany - come early. If you just want to ""see and be seen"" go whenever.",positive
ch458,4/13/2014,revch1127,5,"STK, Fantastic food and ambiance. A bit on the loud side and your wifi won't work. But, I can ignore my phone for an hour while filet mignon oscar style melts in my mouth.",positive

ch458,4/9/2014,revch1129,4,"I was in Vegas a couple of weeks ago and had dinner at STK. I booked a reservation about two weeks in advance for a Tuesday night and all they had left was a 6 PM, so I would definitely suggest booking ahead of time (though they do accept walk-ins if you want to take a chance or wait). All of the food was delicious and came out really quick. I ordered the filet as my entrée and while it wasn't the best I've ever had, it was very good. As it got later and the restaurant began to fill up, the music got louder, which added to the atmosphere. Our waiter was good but I wish he were a little friendlier. It was a bit expensive but on par with other steakhouses and restaurants in Las Vegas. Overall, I would recommend!",positive
ch458,4/8/2014,revch1130,5,"Definitely one of the best (combination of great food and fun place) restaurants I have been at in Vegas. This restaurant has a DJ playing tunes that truly make it a special experience and the diners tend to join in the fun as well. The food was outstanding as well. I had a wonderful steak and my fellow diners had varying fish and meat entrees. The sides were excellent as well with great variety and the wine menu was quite extensive. The chef came to the table to make sure we were enjoying ourselves, which was a great touch! This place is a must if you a visiting Las Vegas and in the mood for a perfect steak.",positive
ch458,4/8/2014,revch1131,4,"Let's talk about the big sirloin, seafood platter, drinks and dessert. It's been a week to this day that I got the pleasure of trying out this contemporary restaurant w/in house dj.  The music was so loud you could barely hold a conversation unless you were two inches apart, which I think is a little on purpose.  ;)...but enjoying such good food, who would mind?!  In fact, I was enjoying it all so much, I should've had my own table.  All I can say is, that was one of the plumpest, juciest meats i've ever had.  My friend ordered a scotch whiskey to accompany it. Not a bad choice and his wife, venison chops, which were delish.
I started with the pear/endive/arugala salad/walnuts/blue cheese crumbles ...very light and tasty followed by a shared plate of carpaccio, which I had heard of..maybe 6 years ago.  Very tasty with the pesto pasta..don't have it any other way!  The Seafood Platter for $40 which included: 2 oysters/ 2 pickled shrimp with jalapenos and red peppers/ alaskan king crab/ 1/4 maine lobster.  It came with the horseradish and usual side sauces but there was another with a little vinegar..you hardly tasted it (and i'm not sure what else was in it) to add a little flavor.  I made the right decision there, as I was trying to keep my dinner as 'natural' as possible..just adding a little kick to it.  I enjoyed my main meal, which is more of an appetizer for me, with a rum/basil/cucumber cocktail.  I could not have been offered a better suggestion.  The dessert was a berry mousse.  Topping it all off with a glass of champagne. One of the best meals of my life. I could not even fathom tainting all the good flavors in my mouth by touching the parmesan truffle fries, which I hear...are the rage. I can't wait to go back, even if it's by myself, at own little table. The pleasure will be all mine.",positive
ch458,4/7/2014,revch1132,3,"I love trying new steakhouses, so I had a lot of past experiences to compare to a new steakhouse experience. STK wasn't the best, but certainly not the worst. I quite enjoyed my experience there. The best thing I could say, it was an experience I have never had before at a steakhouse.

When I think of a steakhouse, usually it involves older white men as servers wearing doctor white coat, dark wood, calf skin or some type of homage to the steer, and the place is usually filled with business people or couples.

This place had none if those above!! It was like a club! It was very modern. There was a DJ, and people dancing around. It was hard to talk as the music was so loud. When you wait for your table at the bar, people may try to pick you up or some lady's boobs were on your face as you turn some other directions. Well, it is Vegas after all! So the atmosphere would be considered ""fun"" unless you hate clubbing. 

I was there with my business associates and one more plus was this meal wouldn't cost me a penny. Before I knew it, wine was flowing, seafood tower and beef tartare were gracing the table. Yum yum yum.. All were delicious!

I ordered a regular filet with foie gras topping. I was pretty happy. The foie put it over the top for sure! I loved it but I had better tasting steak before. I wish I ordered the boned in filet but I was trying to not take advantage of the opportunity. After all, I already topped it with foie gras. It was rather cheap however, $12 for the topping. What a deal.

Some of the guys ordered the boned in filet and porterhouse. They seemed very pleased.

Next to our table, there was a paralyzed guy in an elaborate wheelchair. I guess he was a loaded poker champ that got injured from some accident. Around him, there were at least five scantily clad women dancing around him, worshipping him. They looked hired but whatever, he was having fun and good for him. It was quite a show for us too!

Lastly, our cool server bought our table a round of shots of 1942 tequila and he did the shot with us! How cool.. Never in my life.

So.. See...?! The experience at STK was nothing I have ever had. Not sure if I would go back though, as once is enough.",negative
ch458,4/6/2014,revch1133,3,Good times at STK. Good food and atmosphere. They have a Dj playing all genres of music LOUD. I had the bone in filet ($59) and my girlfriend had the Sea Bass ($60). The food was good but not great. I expected more based on the price but that's what you get in Vegas.,negative
ch458,4/5/2014,revch1134,3,"Was considering 2 stars, but remembered the server was actually pretty cool (and funny). I'm in the hospitality business myself for over 13 years. 

I understand Vegas is different. But after being sat, I just couldn't stop looking around asking myself... ""Are they playing a joke on us?""  

THE MUSIC IS UNBEARABLY LOUD!  We thought it might just be at the front, or the bar area. Nope!  We were sat towards the back and I just couldn't believe it. Again, I get it... It's Vegas, they want the young ""see and be seen"" attitude, but when I can't hear my gf who is inches away, or our server for that matter (until he started yelling to us which was awkward).  I didn't bother asking why the music was so loud, I'm sure they get that often. 

The food was good. Had 3 appetizers and we each ordered a steak. It wasn't the best steak I've ever had, or had in Las Vegas but it was good. Steak grade maybe a 6 out of 10.  

Our table was kind of awkward as well. It was only the 2 of us so you almost have to share a curvy booth with strangers. The table next to us seemed annoyed as well. Maybe this is why the music is so loud, so we don't listen to one another's convo?  Maybe it's so that we eat and go... Thus, they can turn more tables?  

Afraid to say, this is a ""NO GO BACKER"" for me. The food... Maybe but the music being so loud I don't ever want to stand while trying to enjoy a nice meal. 

Tab was ~$320 for 2 people. 3 apps, 1 martini and 2 steaks (not Kobe). 
 I tipped $30%.",negative
ch458,4/4/2014,revch1135,3,"I came on a Saturday night with a party of 5.  We had 7pm reservations and they sat us exactly on time!  The restaurant has a very cool dark sexy vibe.  It is very noisy.. super load music.  

Bread with blue cheese butter and chive oil - 4.5 stars - really enjoyed this dish.  Large load of bread crisp on the outside but very soft in the inside.  Just a hint if blue cheese flavor in the butter.  Delish!

Cucumber Stiletto - 4 stars - very good fresh light drink!
Butternut squash risotto - 4 stars - this dish had a lot of complex flavors. Short rib and risotto was cooked nicely.  The flavors in the sauce on short ribs prevailed over the butternut squash.  The short rib sauce is a veal reduction with red wine and a strong nutmeg finish.  
Crab ravioli - 3.5 to 4 stars -pasta was perfectly cooked, sauce was light.  A very delicate dish.  The taste of crab was almost lost. Adding a touch more crab would perfect this dish.
Burrata - 3 stars - burrata itself was amazing but bread was too soft and dish would have beed better with fresh tomatoes and olives rather than a tapenade 
Corn pudding - 4 stars - super corn delicious!  But I LOVE corn!
Bok choy - 3 stars
Haricot vert - table said 4 stars.  I didn't try them
1/2 lobster - 4 stars - just slightly over cooked but really ever so slightly
Filet w/ bacon butter - 4 stars - this filet was cooked perfectly to medium rare as requested.  Nice and tender. Add
Truffles fries - 4.5 stars - I normally do not like thick fries but these were really really good!

Other things ordered at our tables caesar salad, iceberg salad, sole, skirt steak, Brussels sprouts and tuna.  I did not try these dishes but table consensus was salads were very good but Brussels sprouts and entrees were all just ok and no one would order them again.

We ended the night with a fire ball shot (who's idea was that?) and the bread pudding!  The bread pudding is not traditional.  It is more like a cake.. definitely not as dense as normal bread pudding.  I like the captain crunch pieces as the added a little extra something something!

Amy was our server and she was excellent!  Service overall was impressive!

Unfortunately, I probably won't come here again as it is just too noisy and you have to know what to order to really enjoy your meal.  However, if you are a group of singles looking for a good time this is your place!  This seems like a major pick up joint to see and be seen!",negative
ch458,4/1/2014,revch1136,3,"I'd say this place is more hype than it's actually worth. Steak was eh ok. Nothing memorable especially for $80 piece of meat laden with gristle and A la carte, I could say I was expecting much better quality cut of beef. Steak had lots of gristle and chunks of fat, not palatable at all. It was also served with two different sauces. That should have been the red flag. No self-respecting steak house who claims to serve top quality cuts needs to serve sauce. The meat should speak for itself.

Bread was really good. Had a hint of butter and blue cheese and was a great way to mop up the juices.

For the sides got a creamed corn and mashed potatoes. Nothing fancy or memorable.

Overall dining experience was ok.

For the price I would much rather spend it at a better steak house.",negative
ch458,3/22/2014,revch1137,1,the food is really great good drinks  but terrible atmosphere the music so loud the waiters cant even hear you i work in clubs and their music is alot overpowering than anywhere ive been not good i understand the loungy feeling they want to put out but not to the point its uncomfortable i had their foie gras french toast which was amazing and i think i tried mac and cheese too i ended up leaving and sitting outside and had my meal packed to go i couldnt take the music and i got a migraine. they could do better. the food is amazing but i would never come here again for the sole purpose of the environment. we did ask the waiter if they could lower it a tad bit but if they did it was highly unnoticeable,negative
ch458,3/21/2014,revch1138,1,"I hate giving bad reviews but sometimes they are warranted. 

I had heard this place was the best but we could only get in at 530. The place was fairly empty when we went but got a hard time initially about switching to a more comfortable table/booth. The service was terrible. Our waitress didnt smile once or ask how we were. i felt like she did not even know the menu. It was straight cut to the chase, no friendly service at all. I tried to joke around a bit to lighten her mood but she just stared at me with a deer in the headlights look.

The food was good, no complaints there really but i felt uncomfortable and unwelcome because of the waitress. On our way out the door there were 4 hostesses standing at the front and they stared at us as we left like judging us or something, not one said good bye. Really awkward experience. I will never be back. If I am going to spend that kind of $ I will go somewhere more welcoming. We are well dressed (suit/dresses) and always tip at least 20% if not more. We were treated like we were not welcome and the staff seemed miserable.

If you want to go to a place with better service check out N9NE Steakhouse at Palms, Mortons off Flamingo Road or Gordon Ramsays in Paris Hotel/Casino.",negative
ch458,3/20/2014,revch1139,5,Amazing! Steak cooked to perfection - great wine selection - great service. Can't say anything to change... we'll be back again!,positive
ch458,3/18/2014,revch1140,5,"The romain salad was excellent.  The field greens was very food.  Everyone at the table loved the blue cheese dusted/melted over hot rolls with chive oil dipping sauce.   The bone in rib steak cooked medium was delicious.
And the bacon butter side was good but not worth $13 for a slab of butter.
The mushroom pot pie side was different.  The crust was thin and salty and the mushrooms were sliced thin in a thick cream sort of more like a cream soup than a traditionally thick pot pie.
The brussel sprouts w/bacon was a bit hard but had flavor.
The haricot vert was really tasty. Hard to make green beans that special but I really liked them alot.",positive
ch458,3/17/2014,revch1141,4,"Dinner for four at the lounge. Service was great, food was so tasty. Started with a salad course then moved to steaks & sides, everything was on par or better.

ch458,3/17/2014,revch1142,1,"I must say, the atmosphere is great!  loud fun music, everyone having a great time etc. I would give STK 5 stars for atmosphere however I am giving them 1 star for food!  We were a party if 8, the bill was $1200 and it would have been fine if the food was good!  However the Seabass was over cooked and fishy as if it were old. The lobster Mac and cheese was like Kraft Mac and cheese with lobster flavoring. The Asparagus was super hard with a sweet sauce that just did not go.  We have friends who love the place, but we would never go back again.",negative

Risotto with truffles was yumm too!",positive
ch458,3/16/2014,revch1144,2,Service as not good. The waiter was not attentive to the table because gratuity was included. The entrees took way to long to come out and do did the check and the connecting procedure ....,negative

ch458,3/14/2014,revch1146,1,"The bartender ignored us for the most part.  But eventually we got served. The decor is very nice and there was a dj playing some hip tracks. When our group ordered, the waiter was trying to upsell us hard on dishes (to get a bigger bill because gratuity is included). Someone wanted only a salad but he keep pressuring them to get sides or a pricier entree. The blue cheese/garlic bread they give was interesting. Many diff flavors going on. Kinda weird tasting. I ordered the filet mignon. My steak came over cooked. I like mine medium. I sent it back and they brought back the SAME steak even blacker than before. I called the waiter and he said he misunderstood me. By this time I have not had a meal and my group was finished eating and the wait was on me.  Even with the inconsistencies, I was still billed full price and was never apologized to. I had to ask and point out the issues again to the waiter, and they gave me a free side. Big whoop. Still billed. I was ready to get out. I can't wait to go back to Gordon Ramsey's. Much better overall experience and food.",negative
ch458,3/10/2014,revch1147,5,"Went here for dinner on 3/7 Friday as a party for 3.  We called our host that day to help make reservations.  She said that this restaurant was pretty hard to get into, but was able to get us in at 5:30pm.  We arrived and found the restaurant at 25% capacity, but that changed to about 75% by the time we left.  Great experience over all.
Ambiance:  Great modern steakhouse decor.  Lighting was initially bright when we arrived, but got dimmer as the night wore on.  There was louder music than expected at a steakhouse, but it must be part of the vibe that they are aiming for.  No kids were there (unlike strip house at PH).  We were seated in the center of the restaurant in a serpentine-like booth. Unique set up that could still put you right up against another party.  We were seated next to a party of 2 and we had plenty of room.  
Service:  I thought it was really good.  OUr server came right away and was very friendly and attentive throughout.  Water, bread, food, etc. all came out at a decent pace.  She seemed to have pretty good knowledge about the menu and made decent recommendations.  
Food:  The menu was decent in offerings, not too big or expansive.  They had a variety of different items.  Bread was good and had a nice tasty blue cheese butter on top.  Also went well with the chive oil.  I ordered a customized ""surf n' turf"" with Alaskan crab and the loin steak (medium rare).  Actually came out different than I envisioned it (I thought it would be crab legs next to my steak) and was lumps of crab on top of the steak.  Either way, it was really good. I was a tad pessimistic about ""Loin steak"" but couldn't imagine finishing a rib eye.  So I was very surprised with the flavor of the loin.  The sides of Lobster mac n' cheese, asparagus, and fries were also decent.  Highlight of the meal was the Kobe Wagyu.  We ordered 5 oz (pretty damn pricey, think it was around $40/oz) and it was awesome.  Like eating butter...Dessert of ice cream was also good.

We had a great time and the food was good.  They didn't have as many choices of meat quality that they did at CUT.  I would still return if given the opportunity.",positive

Creamed corn with candied carrots are perfect sides and the sides are really large.  A dozen oysters to start, they were baby size oysters, smallest I've ever had but good and fresh. Wait staff was top notch.  Every need was met immediately.  This is a rare meal that I couldn't eat dessert.  I was full after the entree.  This is Vegas top grossing restaurant. Its not to pricey in my opinion.  Well worth every penny.",positive
ch458,2/24/2014,revch1152,5,Most of the time you have to call the restaurant yourself or use concierge to make your reservation.  If you have plans for a show you will want to have your reservation earlier than normal because people get in here and don't want to leave so keep that in mind.  The later it gets the longer the wait because this place is such a hot spot! The hostess's seem mean and snotty I think they are trained to be that way but they are very good at what they do.

(Uncooked) Ordered ribeye and asked specifically to make sure the meat is cooked Med Rare for myself and a buddy, both came out almost Med Well. Another friends pork chop came out Med Rare. So far, the dining experience was dismal at best.

However, server salvaged it. Talked to her Mgr, he came by and apologized. Got us 3 new entrees (properly cooked), then the chef came out and chatted us up for a bit (and apologized). They then brought out 3 complimentary desserts for us, then knocked off 25% off the entire bill which was a complete surprise.

There was 4 of us so we got a whole bunch of sides, which were family style. I would recommend the mashed potatoes, truffle fries, Mac N cheese.

That being said, the food should be on par with others in its class if you want to be taken seriously. The food here is subpar in comparison. The porterhouse was cooked well and huge, but flavor was lacking. The sides of duck fat fries, bok choy, Mac n cheese were all forgettable. The bread was good as well as my crab salad.

The creamed spinach was fresh and so yummy you forgot you were eating spinach. For apps we did the tuna tar tar which was on the small side but the pecans were a nice add as well as the wedge salad that was so fresh and perfect! The decor was modern, the lighting classy but still had a great rock/pop play list that kept the room filled with energy. Can't wait to go to the STK in Los Angeles. So good!!",positive

The waiter rushed us and asked ""are you done now?"" Didn't ask if we wanted to take any food to go and just grabbed our plates while one of my friend was still eating. So we took our time to order and eat desserts and left 10% tip instead of 20% on 400$ tab.

ch458,2/5/2014,revch1168,3,"We ate here after the Super Bowl with a reservation and the place was packed.  To the restaurant's credit we did not have to wait and we're immediately seated.  the problem was a very strong vomit odor at our table.  All four of us could smell it.  They moved us to another table, but smelling someone's barf was not such a great way to start the evening.  I ordered lobster, two others ordered fish and the entrees were excellent.  My Hamachi appetizer was also excellent and so were the other's salads.  The fourth person in our party ordered a rib eye steak and it was tough and difficult to chew.  To the restaurant's credit, they took the rib eye off the bill with no charge.  The only other negative is that everything is extremely expensive, which is OK, if you don't have to smell barf and get excellent service with excellent food.  So a few negatives, but mostly positive.  Might try it again.",negative
ch458,2/5/2014,revch1169,5,"We rented one of the private rooms and it was an experience I'll never forget. You can turn the music as quiet (so you can talk) or as loud (so you can dance - and we danced up a storm) as you want. Needless to say there was a lot of wine and possibly some dancing on the table. It is Vegas after all and this was the ultimate Vegas experience. 

The service is great as always and it was a really fun way to enjoy a big group. And it's not as crazy expensive as you would think. 

The Seafood sampler - the oysters and crab legs are great. Try the Parmesan fries. And although I didn't try I've heard the pork belly is great.

I got the kurobuta double pork chop and it was wonderful just like everything else. Who doesn't love bacon with their pork chop ;)

We opted out of dessert because we had so much food.

Our table (6) tried 6 different appetizers and salads they were all great, especially the Burrata and the Beets.  Their ahi is money and the steak were great.  The only let down was the dessert (it felt frozen and made with no care).  Service was professional but not overly friendly.  Definitely would go back.  Extremely long wait for bathrooms better off heading outside.",positive
ch458,1/30/2014,revch1172,4,"We did NOT have dinner here, so I can't comment on that. However, we did stop by here for drinks. We had friends eating dinner here, so just wanted to say hello. I'm so glad we did. The vibe here is amazing. Plenty of attractive people...women dressed up to perfection. It's loud, but not too loud. There isn't actually that much room to grab a drink and hang out without being in the way. However, none of the waiters/waitresses have an attitude about passing through. They very politely ask you to move with an ""excuse me"".

The music was bumpin, and some diners even got up and started dancing in the open areas or, like one woman, on the table behind her booth. I was even more impressed with that. Security was on the scene, but just monitored to make sure she was okay. It wasn't like bouncers in the club who get upset and yell at you to sit down. They assessed the situation, saw that she was in control, and let her (and everyone else) enjoy her dance. Again...customer service goes a long way, and they did it right. 

Only minus is that drinks are ridiculously expensive here. I bought a round for 4 people, nothing fancy, and it was about $80. So be prepared, but you'll be sure to have a good time here.",positive

STK is a nice, simple name for a venue when you're texting a group of 15 dudes on a bachelor party for a Saturday night dinner. Let's face it though, any decent steakhouse located in the Cosmo would be killing it right about now regardless of the restaurant caliber. Granted this place is better than average in food quality, ambiance and eye candy, it does lack in service. Sure your server will possess pulchritude and a coquettish demeanor but she'll forget to bring your app or drink, after the 10 minutes you had to wait to flag her down. 
Whatever though, it's the place to see and be seen in Vegas, if you can get a table for your party, that is. In our predicament, we had to haphazardly stroll in in groups of three or four; and that was only to talk our way into geographically undesirable bar tables (since we couldn't get an after 6 reso for the big group). 

The Lamb Chops I ordered made for a solid entree. Albeit my long-time bias to skirt steak, I don't think the price break (comparatively speaking) was worth going with that carne asada option. Also the complimentary bread here is awesome.",positive
ch458,1/25/2014,revch1177,5,"This place kills it every time! We always wait for a table in the top booth area that's wear we like to sit. The hostess sometimes give you a little attitude but hey if I'm paying I'm sitting where I want!
Server last night was great I think his name was mike but I was too busy rocking out to the DJ ( ps shot out to him for playing the Sapphire theme song reminds me of pool season)
We started with the burrata...delish very refreshing and not heavy...also the bread that comes out at the beginning of the meal is amazing 
My husband and I ordered what we call the date steak...the porterhouse. They had it cut up and ready for us to eat and share at the table. Lobster Mac and cheese and lobster mashed is and was a must. We also ordered the haricot vert (green beans) to eat something healthy and green it was awesome too!

The noise level was not super quiet or overall noisy.  A good mix.  The service was really good.  The waiter had some good suggestions for my friends from drinks to sides.  It might not be the best cut of meat you can get it Las Vegas, but it is really good.  More importantly it is a good value, especially for Las Vegas.  I had a group of 4 we need some apps, each had a steak, shared a few sides and had 2 drinks each and dessert.  We were out for under $500.  I paid way more for less at other places.

I know to expect the Vegas price tag, but I do think this place was a bit ridiculous for what you get.  I spent at least $60 and was still hungry.  Sadly enough I can't even remember what I ordered - I know it wasn't bad, but definitely forgettable.  

Service was also a joke.  The girls here look great but were rude and not knowledgable.  Why do I get a blank stare when I ask for a cocktail recommendation?  It's Vegas and I want something fancy!

The cucumber stiletto was fantastic as was the mozzarella bread. They had a nice wine list, but you definitely paid premium pricing for it. The dj was spinning good music, but it was way too loud. Felt like I was dining in a nightclub. The room had a lot of energy and very attractive people. Our server was very entertaining and friendly, but a little slow. His personality made up it.

The environment in STK is always so energetic. The wait staff was very friendly and the service was impeccable. I couldn't have asked for a better dining experience. True professionalism is all that you will receive at STK. The drinks aren't too bad either. Make sure you try the tuna tartar app and make sure you don't pass on the bread with blue cheese crumbles.

My birthday fell on a Monday, which is a special night at STK as they host a DJ and really get the party going. They keep the lighting low, music loud and energy high, making it the perfect place to get the party started!

I started with the Cucumber Stiletto which was crisp and refreshing. We started the meal with the Pear & Endive salad, Tuna Tartare, and a buffalo mozzarella cheese over bread (which they made special for us since we had a vegetarian dining with us that evening). All appitizer dishes exceeded my expectations. I'm not really a fish eater, but I tried the Tuna tartare, and LOVED it!. For the main dishes, my group shared the vegetarian risotto, sea bass over mushroom risotto and loin strip steak. For sides, we got the Corn Pudding, mashed potatoes, and green beans. Everything was excellent. At the end of the meal they came out with a creme brûlée with Happy Birthday written on the dish. I loved every minute at STK and I plan to come back the next time I'm in Vegas.",positive

The waiter basically has to yell to tell you the specials of the night. i asked does he even have his voice by the end of the night.  He told me this was nothing on the weekend the music is louder. lol!  Overall great steak and would probably dine again.,negative
ch458,1/2/2014,revch1190,5,"Amazing from start to finish. Went for a 30th birthday dinner, and we were seated at a beautiful table right next to the DJ. 

Service was impeccable. Our server was clearly a professional in every way. Her recommendations and description of the menu items couldn't have been any better. We took her up on the drink and side dish recommendations, including the truffle fries which were out of this world. My 10oz filet was cooked to perfection, exactly as I had ordered. 

I have one complaint: My boyfriend ordered a GLASS of house red wine. $21?! For house?! That's ridiculous. My vodka drink was $18, which is steep but marginally understandable. But $21 for a glass of house wine? Screw that.

I have been to the STK in Beverly Hills, but this one was soo much better!!! We ordered the seafood tower, foi gras and of course the rib eye. Everything was fantastic. It was so good we were about to go again the day after!

They have a DJ that plays music while you are eating top quality Steaks for $50.  I love this place and every time I am in Vegas I find myself going here.  Some nights it gets real busy and you will have to wait a while for a table.  I would make a reservations first unless you are ok with waiting for a while at the bar.,positive

The music turned up to a 13, the non-existent service and the lack of control over their patrons makes me not want to come back. 

Last time, I thought the thumping tunes were awesome. This time, they were painful. 

Last time, we had a great server who wanted to party with us during dinner, AND after. This time: we had a guy take our drink order, presumably take a nap, take our food order, and presumably take another nap. Later,  some random runners brought our drinks and food. The next time we saw our waiter was about 90 mins later when he brought our check and apologized for the drunk guys sitting at our table, hitting on the hooker that was there with their boss, at the table next to us.",negative

I was standing in mine to use the bathroom and when I commented on the one bathroom issue and this local lady just got all protective and started yapping about how there is another bathroom outside and it's just fine to have one bathroom and all; ok lady take a chill pill. It still does not change the fact that a restaurant like STK has only one bathroom. 
LA STK rules baby. No matter what you say.",negative
ch458,12/11/2013,revch1195,5,"I actually decided to bump up my rating from 4 to 5 for two reasons.

First, our experience at Milo's next door was so bad, it made STK appear like a bigger super star.

Second, I love the hostess and the servers here. Last night I was sick and asked my server for some tissues or napkins. He said he couldn't find any but went to the bathroom and pulled out some toilet paper for me. It was actually really cute and endearing. He didn't want to come back empty handed so he gave me what he could. 

Next, tonight I'm here dining by myself with my laptop and working. I asked for a booth for one and normally there are no booths for one---two is the now minimum. They totally made it happen.  And all of my servers were excellent tonight.

Finally, I have to add that the sea bass (daily fish) with the risotto and mushroom were EXCELLENT.",positive
ch458,12/4/2013,revch1196,3,"I expected so much more from this restaurant. 
We had an early reservation before a show, seated promptly ( place was empty at 6 on a Friday). Started with the citron cucumber stiletto cocktail, very good. Moved on to several dishes beginning ( party of 4) with:
Truffle Fries - oily, poorly seasoned
Beef Carpacio - sooo good, great flavor
Tartare - fresh, great presentation
Beet Salad - big hit, beets w: gorgonzola, super fresh and tasty.
Lobster Cocktail - tinie, tiny.. claw portion with small bits of lobster in tomato broth = absolute waste of money.
For our Entrees we had 2 steaks, risotto, seared ahi, side spinach and Mac n cheese.
All of the entrees were good, not mind blowing or memorable - just good. The Mac n Cheese should be removed from the menu - horrible. The spinach was boring, flavorless. 
The only spark during this experience was our server - she was awesome. 
I definitely won't return, having sampled several items and only appreciating 2 ( beet , carpacio) of them... It's not enough to bring me back.",negative
ch458,12/2/2013,revch1197,5,"Based on the reviews, I didn't quite know what to make of STK.  I was afraid it would be a little too trendy, maybe some ""you're not cool enough to eat here"" attitude.  But the food was fantastic, the service couldn't be better, and not even a hint of 'tude.

Even the bread basket was a treat.  I normally don't like to fill up on bread before the meal, even if it's really good bread.  They brought out just the right amount - enough to take the edge off your hunger pangs without filling you up.  Their take on the bread basket was brioche with blue cheese butter melted on top, served with chive olive oil.  The blue cheese butter was subtle and mild, and the chive olive oil was just delicious.  For an appetizer, we both got the foie gras waffle - seared foie, huckleberries, herb butter & a waffle.  It's a creative combination that turned out to be amazingly delicious.  I get seared foie gras almost anywhere it's served, and this version might be the yummiest I've ever had.

The steak was first rate.  We got the porterhouse and flank steaks, both with foie gras butter.  Both cuts were done just right, and the foie gras butter made for a sinfully rich complement.  I got the asparagus for a side.  What I like about STK is they put a twist on all the steakhouse classics, without being pretentious about it.  Instead of the usual straight hollandaise, they make an orange-japaleno version, and it worked!  For dessert I had the frozen zabaglione, which was basically a semi-frozen eggnog since you couldn't taste any marsala wine (which I don't like anyway, so good).  From bread to dessert, everything at STK was superb.

We managed to finish out meal before the DJ started, so I can't comment on the volume level.  What made our meal a five-star experience was the service.  Our server couldn't have been nicer and more helpful.  When I dropped a knife that made a CLANG! so loud it sounded like it was mic'd up, another server scooped it up a second later.  When I apologized for my very noisy clumsiness, she laughed it off and said don't even think about it.  None of the 'tude I was nervous about, none at all.  Just creative, first-rate food and friendly, professional service.  Also, while STK isn't cheap, it's actually a bit less expensive than most of the top steakhouses on the Strip.

ch484,1/3/2015,revch1201,5,"New Years Eve, three course meal with wine pairing. 

First time here, check in was a little long and delayed for some reason with an awkward silence but I'm not even gonna deduct anything for that because we had a great time at Graze. 

We started out with some rice popcorn and truffle oil. Omg. Addicting. A little Parmesan dust on it. My first drink was a nice citrus with gin. Very good. Can't remember the name of it. 

Appetizers were a Scottish egg perfectly cooked. Second time ever having one and this one out did the last one I had by far. My wife had the foie gras with short ribs. Very very good. My second drink was a Pinot wine. Excellent pairing. 

Onto dinner, two different meals. My wife's lobster style poutine with gnochi was very cheesy and heavy. Almost a little too greasy and heavy. Tasted good but maybe would of chosen something different if we would of known how greasy it was going to be. Had us at lobster. I had a GREAT pork loin with lentils. First time having lentils. Delicious cherry sauce that complimented the pork perfectly. Wasn't familiar with my third glass of wine but went well with the pork.

NOW...the show stopper of the night. The cheesecake with rhubarb and chocolate cake were to die for. Absolutely, hands down thee best deserts I think we've ever had. My port wine was delicious as well but I can't rave enough about these desserts. Amazing. 

Great service and a top notch place. We definitely went to come back and sample the rest of the menu.",positive
ch484,12/31/2014,revch1202,2,"Oh Graze, how you disappointed me. As a foodie traveling with other foodies, we scoped out the Madison food scene prior to our work trip and pegged Graze as THE place we had to try. Glowing reviews, amazing location, an intriguing-looking menu...what could go wrong?!

Our party of 4 arrived around 6pm and the place was packed. We were given a 1-1.5 hour wait time. This place is tiny so waiting at the bar was not an option unless we wanted to stand over tables and hover on top of people trying to eat. We were given a pager so we went across the street to a dive bar called The Tipsy Cow (tip: go there instead! Great spot!) to wait. After an hour, we were paged so we returned.

The space here can generously be described as cramped. We squeezed into our small table and were consistently bumped repeatedly throughout the meal by servers passing through. The volume is loud here so expect to shout a bit while conversing. That being said, you cannot top the view: floor to ceiling glass windows overlooking the capitol building. Truly lovely and the best part of Graze for sure.

We started with a few small plates: cheese curds (of course), pork buns, truffle popcorn and soft pretzels. So, part of our quest was to try cheese curds everywhere we went on this trip and Graze is no exception. Where did they rank? Dead last. Our party unanimously agreed these curds were pretty nasty-- vodka batter served with house ranch and the flavors were horrific. We didn't finish the basket. First time!

The pork buns were paltry, basic and bland. I've had much better at a much cheaper price elsewhere. Not worth ordering as they are forgettable.

The truffle popcorn was a big miss. The basket remained full when the waitress took it away. We all took a single bite and found it to just be a misfire, plain and simple. While we appreciate the concept, the execution fails-- it's weird tasting ultimately and this feedback is coming from west coasters who hail from the land of putting ""nutritional yeast"" on popcorn at the movies voluntarily. We all felt its potential but it did not deliver. Do not order this.

The pretzels were very good. However, they are a very small portion so a party of 4 would need to order 2 of these. The pretzels were our group's favorite bite at Graze.

As for entrees, I ordered a fried chicken and waffles plate. I had big expectations, I cannot lie. Where I live in Oregon, we have a waffle food truck that makes this exact meal for $6 and it's out of this world, so going to a ""gourmet"" place to try their version smelled like nirvana. Sadly, 'twas not to be. First, the portions were RIDICULOUSLY HUGE. It was offensively big, honestly. WTF. Who needs that much food?! I wish I had taken a picture. I felt embarrassed having it front of me because I felt like a huge pig. So, despite the insane size, the chicken itself was black on the outside. Black. Beyond charred. Burned black. Ok, so it's going to be a carbon experience. Got it. Still, I plowed onward and cut into that black bird and found-- surprise!! Bone dry chicken! What a shock when it's burned black to have it be inedible and dry.  The waffle was subpar. Too big, too soggy, zero flavor. It came with syrup which I attempted to douse the food with in an attempt to get some sort of flavor-- maybe the syrup was the secret ingredient that pulled it together and made it come alive? Nope. I took 2 bites and couldn't eat another. My group all tried it and they agreed with me that it was just bad food, period.

One person with me ordered the pub burger, served on an english muffin of all things. He found it to be very average, questioned the $11 price tag and missed a decent bun. English muffin, while it's obvious they are trying to be trendy and different, ultimately reads kind of cheap, sorry.

Finally, one person got the trout and was very pleased, so that was a success at least. Drinks and service were also top-notch.

After our huge expectations and our disastrous results, we bailed on dessert-- we lost interest and we all agreed we wished we had stayed at The Tipsy Cow and gotten a bar burger instead. Overall, our experience with Graze was sadly disappointing and a huge letdown after we went in with such high expectations and excitement. None of us would return.",negative
ch484,12/20/2014,revch1203,4,"I went to Graze for lunch with my aunt and uncle who were visiting. I remember my aunt's order better than my own. She got a Bibimpap Korean burrito. I'm not a big fan of kimchi, but it was yummy with just enough allusions to Korean flavors.. yet, I think,it was toned down for the sake of your average person's ""spicy!"" threshold 


I ended up with the leftovers from the burrito, and then some soup which I currently forget.. but was yummy as well.

As I write, I'm remembering what I couldn't stop eating: we ordered deep fried cheese curds. Whatever they put out as dipping sauce, don't stop!
Could it have been as simple as like a garlic mayo? Insanely delicious. 
Environment, 5/5 of course.
That's all I've got.",positive
ch484,12/14/2014,revch1204,4,"This place was really nice with high ceilings. My friends and I went for dinner around 9:45 pm on a Saturday night and as it was late, we were seated immediately.

I didn't have any drinks but my friends did and they said there was a large variety and they were pretty good. They also served beer in wine glasses which was interesting. The entire back of the menu listed where the restaurant obtains each ingredient which reminded me of portland. 

We started off with an order of cheese curds with ranch. They were absolutely delicious and cheesy! They tasted amazing with the ranch. I think the full portion ($9) would be too much for 2 ppl FYI (assuming you each have a main course coming). For my main meal, I got the ""Moules Frites"" ($17) which was a huge bowl of mussels in a tomato white wine sauce. It was a tiny bit spicy but it was pretty good! The waitress convinced me to get bread for an extra dollar to dip with but i thought the bread was too hard and didn't absorb the mussel sauce very well so I would not recommend that. The fries tasted really good with the garlic aioli sauce as well. My hubby got the ""Graze Burger"" ($21) with a salad. He said the burger was pretty good but he wouldn't get it again for $21... It was a bit pricey. I had a bite of my friends Mac and cheese, it tasted pretty good too but I would not get the pulled pork with it. 

Also, the waitress charged all of us a 20% service charge. I'm used to an 18% service charge for big parties and we would have tipped her 20% anyway but it was just unusual. We also split 3 orders of cheese curds among 10 ppl and she charged each of us 3/10 appropriately and gave us all separate checks which was nice! Overall, it was a nice dinner!",positive
ch484,12/12/2014,revch1205,4,I was here with a group of friends this summer on my first tour around Madison. We went around 3.30 pm on a Saturday after going to the farmers marker and going round and round in Madison. Ordered the pickle board and veg bibimbap. Loved it!!!! Absolutely loved it!!!! I don't care about the place being pricey. We shared the bibimbap between two people and we were both full and couldn't finish it. The food was amazing!!!! And the first time I ever tried the spotted cow and loved that too!,positive
ch484,12/6/2014,revch1206,3,"I'm sorry Graze. I love your food but my most recent experience with your server has forced me to downgrade my love for you. And probably not return for a long time. 

I did not get the name of this said male server but I had the unfortunate experience of being unattended for such lengthy periods of time (this has never happened at any of my other experiences at Tory Miller's restaurant, or any decent restaurants). I had to request the help of other servers/hosts at least 3 times to locate where my server is. He just disappeared. And every single time he appeared he was in a hurry. To disappear again, probably. 

I enjoyed my cheese curds and kimchi burrito, however I wish there were smaller portions of both. Even sharing half with my boyfriend didn't stop me from feeling overloaded after the meal... The cheese curds seemed a tad salty after half a basket of them but still love the melty cheese! 

Yeah.. Be warned, come unhungry and be prepared to wait if you get said unfortunate server. Sigh, what a misfortune. One of my favorite local restaurants have to be tucked aside for the next few months.",negative
ch484,11/23/2014,revch1207,5,"Ambiance: 5. Graze checks all the boxes. Outstanding view of capitol building, a modern feel which the restaurant ""owns"" by using floor to ceiling glass, relatively small tables, and a very crisp/clean look with everything else. As others mentioned a tad loud but that's to be expected given high ceilings, and actually not all that bad considering this fact.

Cost: 3. Agnostic here, I'm assuming for Madison this place is a bit on the pricey side but well worth it given other categories.

Food Quality: 5. Very unique farm-to-table menu with a wide range of food options for those with unique circumstances (Gluten-free, etc.) and a large step up from what was described as ""American"" cuisine.  All ordered dishes were outstanding and despite being from what I would consider different cuisines: sauteed vegetables, bibimbap, oysters, etc. Looking around I'd also feel very safe ordering anything from seasonal menu.

Service: 5. In typical midwestern fashion, folks were extremely friendly and helpful.

ch484,11/19/2014,revch1208,5,"Graze is my favorite restaurant in Madison. Not only is the view incredible, but the atmosphere and food are unbeatable. The menu changes with the season which makes it that much more exciting each time you go. The food is fresh and local-- never over the top. You can always get classics like mac and cheese and the best cheese curds ever. Or you can go crazy and try one of their more creative dishes like my favorite beet and walnut burger on a pepita bun. The restaurant itself is trendy yet sophisticated and the service is great. The restaurant is well run and even when the wait is very long, they have a website that shows where you are in line and texts you when your table is ready. Overall, Graze never disappoints. Come for the food, view, and energy!",positive
ch484,11/16/2014,revch1209,3,"The menu is very pretentious. It seems like every entree is over the top extravagant. I ended up getting the Mac and cheese which was good, but really only for it because I didn't want anything else on the menu. My boyfriend got pork and didn't love it. From a guy who will eat and try just about anything he had a few bites and couldn't finish it.  The cheese plate was the best part of our meal and popcorn was good but nothing to rave about. I'd try it again for brunch but that's the only reason I'd go back.",negative
ch484,11/15/2014,revch1210,4,Vodka battered cheese curds are a must try. And maybe you want to compare who's got better cheese curds in town. The pork buns are great. Beet burger is delicious. Biscuits and gravy for brunch is my fave. It's a big portion so you can share with four ppl. Waffles and pancakes are hard to miss. Chicken and waffle was okay. The burgers they offer are delicious. It's great knowing the food you eat is made from local ingredients.,positive
ch484,11/15/2014,revch1211,4,"We were told that we needed to come to this restaurant, not primarily for the food but for the view. We were not disappointed. The restaurant is enclosed by floor to ceiling glass windows, and beyond the windows are a pretty sweet view of the capital. Especially gorgeous during the evening. 

The first thing I noticed about this restaurant though, is that it gets loud. I'm talking, ""I need a drink to tune everything else out"" kind of loud. Just a note. If you're a notorious over-orderer like I am, then try to snag a seat at a bar or a booth if possible, the tables in the center of the restaurant seem a little small.

As for the menu, there are a handful of market entrees you have all sorts of options including beef, fish, scallops, and tofu. The farm to table concept here is huge. The backside of the menu showcases all the local food supplies that Graze sources their food from. Eat local! There is also a small selection of other items to choose from which include traditional favorites like burgers, fried chicken and mac and cheese. Just for good measure, there's also a bibimbap on the menu--us rice loving Hawaii people appreciated this! 

While the Graze Burger seems to get all the hype around here, I wasn't in the mood to eat a full on cow so I decided to go with the Pub Burger and switched the regular beef patty with the beet and walnut patty. I'm no vegetarian (pls, I'm the girl who says a meal is not a meal if there's no meat in it), but I do love all beet everything and this was no exception. The flavor of the patty was certainly unique; it didn't replicate the flavor of a beef patty, but I don't think that was the intention here. I liked the subtle notes of sweetness from the beets, and the ground up walnuts did a good job in making the patty dense and moist. Using a toasty english muffin in lieu of a traditional burger bun was also very different, but I liked this change as well.

The cheese curds were delicious, deep fried goodness! I don't have much to compare it to, but it's hard to screw up cheese and fried stuff. Together with the house ranch, the curds are an artery clogging party--obviously the best kind.

Definitely worth checking out if you're in the area. Nice ambiance and great food!",positive

ch484,11/12/2014,revch1213,3,"I tried the noodle bowl here and was disappointed. It wasn't worth the price for what I got. The noodles were maybe a little overcooked or just too soft. I love the concept and the farm to table type ideas, but the dish I had was just lacking. I wish I had tried something else instead. The lemonade of the day was pretty good though. I might come back here to try another item on the menu next time since I did like the environment.",negative
ch484,11/12/2014,revch1214,3,"Brunch was awful, service was slow, waiters were judgmental, but I'd go back for the laughs.",negative
ch484,11/12/2014,revch1215,2,"I finally got to Graze last Friday night. I have attempted to go before but didn't want to endure the lines. They do not take reservations for parties under four. We put our names on the list, then headed to a nearby bar as there was no room at the Graze bar itself. They do have a very cool virtual wait list app that allows you to see where you are in line via a weblink. The system texts you when your table is ready. The 20 minute estimate turned into an hour.

I have heard a lot of good things about Graze but after experiencing both their food and their service, quite frankly, I'm not sure what the hype is about. While good, it was not a stand out in any way. I think they might want to visit places like Nostrano or even Odd Duck in Milwaukee to get an idea of what's missing here. 

The space is large and vibrant with terrific views of the State Capitol building across the street. A large square bar is surrounded by tables. The atmosphere is gastropub casual and the place is quite loud.

We first ordered a couple drinks from the specialty cocktail menu. These took forever to get to the table. So long that we had actually ordered our food and received one of the dishes. The waiter, who was scarce all night long, to his credit did apologize for the lateness of the drinks and comped one of them on the bill. 

The first dish was a beet salad:

Honeycrisp apple, Hook's 10-year cheddar, pickled beets, cranberry spiced vinaigrette

While the description looked great, the salad was dry. I was very curious about the cranberry spiced vinaigrette, but could barely detect it in the salad. While I liked the aged cheddar as a compliment to the beets, the dish needed acid. I tried to find the waiter to request some vinaigrette, but he was nowhere to be found. 

The next dish was the most expensive thing on the menu:

Scallops with shaved black truffles at a whopping $35. The dish consisted of four scallops, some greens, roasted potatoes and shaved black truffle. Black truffle is a very expensive, luxurious ingredient and typically it is very savory. Somehow they had found one with literally no flavor in it. Huge shavings of black truffle were completely flavorless. The potatoes in the dish were overcooked such that they were rubbery. The scallops were cooked perfectly and were, themselves, very nice. Four scallops, however, should run you about 12 bucks. Buck & Honey's in Sun Prairie has a much better scallop salad at a fraction of the cost as does North Star Bistro in Milwaukee. 

I tried to find the waiter to complain about the scallop dish but to no avail. We decided to quite literally cut our loses at this point and hunted down the check. 

With so many amazing restaurants in Madison (Nostrano, Pig in a Fur Coat, Forequarter, Sardine, etc.) I have no idea why this place is thriving. I would much rather head down to Sardine and have every dish amaze me as opposed to revisit this place. Not recommended.",negative

We placed the other, it took them more than 25 min to bring it out (and that would be fine). A few of us got the eggplant sandwich, which turns out is pre-made (seriously? the food carts out there manage to make sandwiches on the spot!). The bread was so soggy I had to leave it (which for anyone who knows me, this is very rare). The fries were cold and greasy. I would have gotten better food at a gas station (and I would have not paid 12 bucks for it). Horrible, horrible.

They actually took the time to talk through preparations with her and offered to bring any questions to the chef if needed. That, my friends, is quality service.

ch484,10/26/2014,revch1222,4,"Ok, I gave Graze a 4 because for brunch, they're probably about a 3. But the Graze burger is a surefire 5. I'd skip brunch here and just save room for dinner. The graze burger is honestly one of the better things I've ever tasted.I mean.....

fresh ground bacon, sirloin, ribeye & short ribs, caramelized onions, Worcestershire-cabernet jus, Swiss Emmental compound butter, SarVecchio sesame brioche, with fries & aioli (Modify to GF/DF)

For brunch, I was fooled into getting the pub burger, thinking it was the Graze burger. DO NOT MAKE THIS MISTAKE. The pub burger is just a burger. The Graze burger is otherworldly. The beet salad is also really nice. The curds are probably top 5 curds in Madison, and I LOVE the truffle popcorn.

Ok so for brunch, I've had the chicken fried steak, and others have gotten the pub burger and the corned beef hash. All of them were pretty good, but the portions aren't too large. The chicken fried steak is definitely a favorite of mine, but I wouldn't hate if it were a little bigger.

It's pretty tough to get a table at Graze- you should always have someone go at least 30 minutes ahead of when you want to be seated to put in your name (they don't take call ahead reservations). One nice thing is that they'll take your number and text you when your table is ready, so you can explore the area around the capitol while you wait. Also the people-watching from the tables is top-notch. I usually will wait a few more minutes to be seated against the windows. Last thing is that the wait staff comes off as a little pretentious... I've found that it's very hit or miss. Sometimes we'll get someone really relatable and nice, and other times there will be people that I imagine rolling their eyes at me as soon as they turn around. Also what's up with the tiny dishes of ketchup?! I'll take the full bottle, please.",positive

The servers were also very attentive and patient, and I had a positive experience all around. Though the wait was quite long every time (without the option to set a reservation), I would say it was worth the wait each time.

Every time I have gone, I always get the bone marrow and my boyfriend gets the cheese curds. The bone marrow at Graze is definitely the best I've had in Madison. I also love the mussels on the menu with the side of bread they offer. With the changing menu, I'm always excited to try new things. Although on the slightly expensive side, definitely worth it. I recommend going on a date or taking your parents when they visit to really impress them.

I WAS SO WRONG! This place is wonderful! *and if you're like me, there are LOTS of meat options on the menu (and vegetarian options of course)
It's got a great menu (and drink list) and I've been back many many times since my first experience (they serve a fabulous brunch). Some of my favorite things to get there is the cheese platter (just tell your server what kinds of cheese you like and they will make some recommendations), the oysters on the half shell (because that is always a great option, and their carrot cake (I cannot believe it's vegan and Gluten free. I usually don't bother with restrictive diet options like that, but it is SO GOOD)

I was a little surprised (and skeptical) that the menu had so many Asian-inspired dishes but ordered an assortment to ""graze"" on anyways. Tried the pork buns, cheese curds, pretzel, and bibimbap. 

The pork buns were unimpressive. The buns were a little too steamy at wet and the pork belly was just okay. I will definitely reserve my pork bun ordering for a Chinese restaurant. The cheese curds were good but I'd still prefer the curds from the WI State Fair any day. The pretzel was decent but the real star would have to be the assorted dipping sauces -- several types of mustard and cheese. As for the bibimbap (the dish I was most skeptical about).. it was actually pretty darn good. It contained Korean BBQ pork, a generous portion of assorted veggies (which I appreciated), and an egg. BUT the best part of the bowl were the surprise little cubes of crispy rice. It added a nice touch of crispiness that I've never before experienced in a bowl of bibimbap. Definitely a pleasant surprise.",negative

ch484,10/13/2014,revch1234,3,"I'm not sure how we ended up at Graze most evenings this summer, but that's just the way the cookie crumbled. Speaking of cookies, I had their cookies and milk three times last month, then went out and bought a gallon of Sassy Cow milk because milk never tasted so good. Before my first Sassy Cow experience here, I thought milk was supposed to taste like the inside of a refrigerator, that's how city I am. Then I went to the World Dairy Expo and learned a lot about the dairy industry and how in most restaurants (except Graze) you should just order chocolate milk if you're going to order milk at all. 

Graze has consistently good ambiance for dessert and drinks, and it's a nice place with ample seating to take out-of-town guests. On Saturdays you'll have to be willing to wait for a table, but they have a high-tech messaging system, so if you're not scared of the NSA and giving away your mobile phone number to the stranger-hostess, you can wander the square for a second-choice spot in case the wait is long. 

Sometimes they're adventurous with their brunch and cocktail menu, and sometimes those adventures succeed. I would give their seasonal punches a chance or two, and the bibimbap burrito was a win example. But, be careful what you wish for, because they're so fashion by the time you try getting your hands on an item, it's probably been discontinued and already all over Instagram.",negative

I had a bloody mary that was good.  Very different flavor than what I'm used to, and I really enjoyed it.

Came here for lunch at about 1:30PM, so it was pretty empty. First thing you notice is the extremely white and sleek decor; I thought this place was like a tech company or something when I was walking in. The staff is really attentive and nice; after reading some of the other reviewers I really don't understand the problems with the service. They have cute little water pitchers and tall, skinny glasses so you never have to go thirsty but you can still have water in a reasonably formal manner. It's a little bit pretentious, I admit, but it worked for me.

I got the gazpacho soup of the day with toasted bread and goat cheese, beet and walnut burger, and cheese curds. How did a carnivore like me manage to order a vegetarian meal? I have absolutely no idea upon reflection, but whatever; it was all good.

The gazpacho soup of the day was good at best on its own, but that goat cheese was absolutely heavenly; and I've had my share of goat cheeses. Perfect for the warm day that it was.

Who would've thought that the star of the meal was the cheese curds? Not me. But those cheese curds were better than Old Fashioned cheese curds; and that's saying something. Graze cheese curds are massive. There's just something about the bigger size and tangy dill sauce that kept my mouthgasm going on for a lot longer and repeatedly.

That beet and walnut burger also had some serious flavor. The patty had a surprisingly pleasant texture that definitely didn't really remind me of a normal burger, but it was sweet and fragrant while not being overwhelming. To be honest, it almost acted like a buffer between the other flavor explosions in within the burger. My only complaint was that the bun was loaded with grease (from what, even?? It was literally veggies, some sauces, and the patty), especially the bottom. Oil? I can tolerate, especially in a veggie burger. But having to hold the bottom bun coagulating not because of watery juices, but from oil, definitely took away from the experience.

The prices were also a touch high here. That walnut burger (alone) would probably have been more appropriately priced at $9, and the cheese curds a dollar or two lower.

But overall, a really solid place. Come if you're in the vicinity. Good food, good flavors, good ambience, and good service, for high-ish prices.",positive

I also had the cheese curds which were huge and packed with delicious cheese. The only thing I did not enjoy was the special lemonade they had. It was unique but not for me. I highly reccomend trying Graze if you are in the Madison area.,positive
ch484,9/20/2014,revch1246,2,"Meh. I haven't been here in awhile, and tonight's visit was horrible. Very sad, considering several good visits I've had.
Our server was terrible, and made no attempt at being pleasant. She seemed miserable, talked very quietly and just didn't seem like she wanted to exist. Never have I had a server who so clearly needed a career change. Also, when we mentioned the over-cooked chicken, she showed no empathy, and merely muttered ""I'm sorry"" and quickly scurried off. It was very odd.
My Mac & Cheese (with pulled pork for extra$) was mediocre, and the pulled pork wasn't very hot. It didn't taste great and was mushy and flavors were muddled. Mac & Cheese is classic comfort food, and this was simply uncomfortable. Not recommended.
One of us ordered the Chicken & Waffles-which is usually delicious-and even that was an overcooked mess! The breading was so crunchy that it was painful to eat, like eating sand.
The bibimbap was also not amazing.
The restaurant remains beautiful, but it gets very loud.
At these prices, the food really should be exceptional. It was not. The service was awful. I appreciate the farm-to-table effort, but this visit wiped away all prior visits I've made to Graze. I'll probably be back again, but pray that this was just an ""off"" night at Graze.",negative
ch484,9/20/2014,revch1247,5,This place is great! The ambiance is excellent - you have great Capitol views and tons of light streaming in. The staff is super helpful (my water glass was never empty for long) and the food is creative and local. It's my favorite place to brunch In the city!,positive

Located just steps from the capital and owned by the team behind L'Etoile, my dinner destination later that evening, it was to Graze that my lunch plans led me after a tour of Camp Randall Stadium and although expediting from the kitchen would prove oddly paced, at best, my meal in the sunbathed space left very little to be desired.  Featuring a farm-fresh menu focused heavily on Wisconsin purveyors with floor-to-(20+foot)-ceiling windows offering wide views of the midday bustle outside it was near the rear of the restaurant that I opted for a shaded seat and with a menu of daily specials alongside several signatures a three-course meal of small plates was created, the service itself perfectly pleasant in offering up apologies for long delays from a kitchen that was dreadfully slow in preparing something as simple as a charcuterie board despite the restaurant being less than 1/3 full.  Certainly not starving after a hearty breakfast it was after nearly thirty-five minutes that my selection of three cheeses and two meats with several house-made accoutrements arrived and with each item tallying $3-to-$3.50 aside from the ultra-aged cheddar I'll simply say the additional $5 surcharge was entirely worthwhile, a sharp bite to the golden wedge better than any I tasted in England and just inching out the pate de Campagne for best thing on the pig-shaped board.  Having mentioned issues with the kitchen I was unfortunately only a quarter into the charcuterie when my three hot plates arrived and setting aside the cold board with a bit of annoyance I found even more frustration with the overcooked pork belly, a limp and flavorless bao doing little to improve the flavor as pickled cabbage dominated each bite.  Moving past the buns to things far superior it was next in Graze's signature curds that I did partake and squeaky-as-hell with plenty of brine I greedily dipped each bite in ranch - a flavor I generally dislike adding an aromatic finish to each bite.  No less impressed by a salty pretzel with delicate chew beneath a soft, golden top it was back to the charcuterie that I turned as plates were collected and opting for one of three desserts another long delay would transpire, the twenty minutes thankfully justified by a hot slice of pie loaded with nuts and molten caramel atop a crisp and buttery crust.",negative

They always have great beers on tap and their pub burger is served on an English muffin.. It's good.  They also have a buy one, get one happy hour that starts after 9pm on tapped beers.  Tough to beat that.  The bartenders I've had have always been friendly as well.",positive

I can't wait to visit Madison again so I can get that bibimbap burrito.",positive

ch484,9/2/2014,revch1255,5,"GRAZE was such a treat, from start to finish. Every aspect of this place was a win! It felt upscale but simplistic at the same time. We ordered off the happy hour menu- coffee, cheese board, pork bun, salad, and cheese curds--- a must! If you don't try the curds you are doing it wrong. Visiting from Seattle and just driving through Madison for the day, I'm happy we went here. Check it out",positive
ch484,9/2/2014,revch1256,3,"Definitely a great place, but I couldn't get over thinking it was over rated and over priced. The food is fresh and tastes good, but the portions were small and I felt they were quite varied between the dishes. 

If you get really excited about ""farm-to-table"" you might give them an additional star, but there are tons of restaurants in Madison serving farm fresh/responsible ingredients without going on and on (and on) about it every chance they get.

Would I come back? Sure, but not until I eat at a lot of other places first.",negative
ch484,8/31/2014,revch1257,5,"Been here several times since visiting our son at UW. Always liked the place and the food, but this past trip (8-29-14) we had a 5 star experience. First off, as before, we ordered some deviled eggs as a starter, and they were really tasty. I drank a Kir Royale (with cava and Creme de cassis). WOW!! Refreshing!! My wife, son and I then shared a bowl of mussels (a bit spicy for my taste) and a fresh salad, and then dove into some fabulous oysters. We all finished off with some artisan cheeses and meats that were out of this world. Also had some keg wine which was really good.

The bartender and server were very knowledgeable and totally there for us. The vibe here is really Wisconsin friendly. The view of the capital across the street is special.

Thanks Graze!!",positive
ch484,8/30/2014,revch1258,5,"I went to Graze last night and had the beet salad and Mac n Cheese, both were excellent. The beet salad has lightly dressed greens over a bed of al dente roasted beets topped with a table spoon of goat cheese each, garnished with candied walnuts. The Mac n Cheese came in a nice matted black cast iron dish with light bread crumbs on top. It was creamy with a hint of sharpness from the 10 year aged cheddar. Very good service and we were seated immediately at around 5 pm.",positive
ch484,8/28/2014,revch1259,5,"Very impressed.  

Everything was spectacular.  From the spot itself, and it's ambiance, to the well thought out menu, locavore food, preperation, delivery, and service.  Well done!

I started out with a WI made saison with rhubarb.  Unique and delicious.  

For some reason I am a complete sucker for wedge salads.  Had to give it a try.  Glad I did.  This wedge is a little less typical, including the obligatory iceberg lettuce, but topped with smoked mushroom, blue cheese, ranch & sesame ""french"" dressing.  Outstanding.  

For my entree I went with a vegetarian option.  This is not something I normally do.  No meat, all vegetarian usually screams ""side dish"" to me.  I couldn't resist with this though.  Pan fried rye gnocci tossed with a variety of roasted veggies and a cauliflower puree.  Not only was it beautiful, it was absolutely delicious.  The order was on the smaller side, but honestly I was happy.  In the meantime I had added on a couple of WI based IPA's and was starting to get full.  I was happy to have room for some cheese to finish the night.

Ended my night with a bottle of WI Belgian sour cherry lambic style beer along with a selection of cheeses.  There were a great number of cheeses to choose from, from at least 4 different WI area farms.  My only complaint, and it is small - the printed descriptions of the cheese were lacking information.  Just as happens with craft beers these days, I have no idea what ""old curmudgeon"" is.  Thankfully my server jumped to action and came up with 4 selections, one from each farm, and all different from each other.  He also hand wrote a quick note to me, explaining what each cheese was.  Great service - very well done.

Graze is  a very rare, well polished, locally concerned, gem of a restaurant.  
The staff is so professional, knowledgeable, and well trained, that their service comes off as casual, and completely un-stuffy.

Especially with those fried cheese curds. Man, those things are how cheese curds were meant to be. It's not on their lunch menu but you can get just a half order for 5$ if you want!

They were freshly made and so good I immediately wished we'd ordered two plates. 

The location is beautiful, and the restaurant is very cool inside. Our service was pretty good, too. We brought our young sons with us, and they loved the food as well.

For the meal, we went all out and ordered two appetizers -- the fried cheese curds and the deviled eggs. They were both delicious, especially the cheese curds. For the entrees, my partner had the steak and I had the pan-fried gnocchi. Both were incredible. We washed it all down with some Bulleit bourbon on the rocks, which was fairly priced.

I also had the gyro meatballs. This was good, too, but I really shouldn't have had both the late AND the meatballs...I am about to burst out of my pants!

Lastly, and most unnotably was the wedge salad. It was their interpretation of this classic salad - mushrooms instead of bacon, sesame ranch dressing and a heaping mound of shredded radish and carrots.

Secondly I ordered the Pub Burger.  I ordered it medium rare and got it medium well.  I asked for it with no mustard, but the waitress insisted that it was ok because the condiments all come on the side.  Little did I know that the condiments were all sort of mixed together so I had a hard time getting the ketchup/mayo without the mustard.  Bacon tasted very old.

Graze also has highly professional, charming wait staff. 

Graze's food is less consistently excellent, marred chiefly by Graze's ambitions to ""be taken seriously."" Consider, for example, Graze's pickle plate. Certainly, pickling has experienced a renaissance. And we were carefully told by magazines (three years ago) that it is ""what's hot."" The truth is, however, pickling is a tricky process. It is entirely too easy to get a brine that is too sweet, too spiced, too salty, and the like. As a result, Graze's pickle plate has six options, two of which are good, four of which are entirely forgettable. Similarly, their noodle bowl was superior, while their tofu club was, well, oily. 

In short, Graze has big dreams, and sometimes it realizes them.",negative
ch484,6/5/2014,revch1296,5,"Loved this place during a visit to see friends in Madison.  Very organic and farm to table concept.

I had the Bibimbap, which had a ton of vegetables, pork, and a really nice spicy sauce.  It was a great portion.  My wife had the Beet & Walnut Burger.  She just couldn't get over how awesome it was.  We were in Madison 4 days and only went to Graze once.  Next time, I will go every day!  It was that good.",positive
ch484,6/4/2014,revch1297,4,"My family and I went to Graze on May 30 to have my post-birthday celebration. What a beautiful space - volume ceilings and so much natural light! My first impression was a good one. It's a laid back/casual environment which I really enjoyed.  Our server, Jesse L., was just so lovely and genuine - she took great care of us. The rhubarb lemonade and wine were all so good! We had heard a lot about the cheese curds so we ordered those as an appetizer to share.  They were wonderful and honestly, the most enormous cheese curds I've ever seen. My only disappointment was the ""ranch"" dipping sauce which was just way too sweet for my taste.

For dinner, my husband got the mac & cheese with pork and the asparagus appetizer as a side. Both were very, very tastey. I ordered the $21 Graze burger and people, seriously, it was worth every penny. The rich, decadent combination of meats smothered with caramelzied onions on a brioche bun - it was ridiculously good! I paired it with the greens covered in a champagne viniagrette that was a perfect, light pairing to my burger. My mom got the chicken and waffles which she loved - cinnamon, cardamom, salty, crunchy, golden goodness. And my mom's girlfriend went with the lemongrass sausages & coconut rice - she was very happy with her dinner as well. It was a great first experience and we will definitely be back!!!",positive

I would allow this place to drain me of all my funds and savings so I can savor their seasonal delicacies that is inspired by Mother Nature's bounty.

Last time I was here, I had my favorite fusion caprese salad.  It was fried Zucchini Blossoms topped on a bed of Wisconsin Fresh Mozzarella and Wisconsin Heirloom tomatoes, with a generous drizzle of Korean Gochujang aoili.  Don't know what Gochujang is?  Google it.  

This time, I couldn't resist and went with a healthy 3 course menu.  As my starter, I had their grilled asparagus with Muenster Cheese Curds.  mmmmm.... it was decorated with shavings of fresh asparagus!  The contrast in the vegetables was amazing!  Same vegetable... with 2 totally different taste!  \

Entree:  Vietnamese Sausage with Coconut Rice and Homemade Daikon Vegetables.  It tasted like a deconstructed bahn mi with a side of coconut rice.  I wonder what it would taste like in a bahn mi sandwich?  Chef.. could you make this happen one day?  :)  Maybe let me know too if you make this happen so I can drive up from Chicago.

Dessert:  Grasshopper sundae with Italian Merengue.  I almost wished I had a 2nd stomach so I can fit this whole sundae in my already stuffed belly.  Words can't describe the warm and creamy, heavenly delight.  Look at the pictures.

My problem is for a place that is trying to do chef'd-up comfort food, the portions are too small and prices too high. They call themselves a gastropub but to me there's just not that chill pub vibe. Too much sleek, modern, overly composed wannabe fine-diningness. 

Again, the food is pretty good, but I've never left the place feeling like I've gotten a good value. I'm willing to throw down plenty of money in a restaurant, just here I feel like I spend too much for what I get.",negative

ch484,5/6/2014,revch1308,5,"I am sold on their lunches, dinners and weekend brunches. This is a must-go regardless of the time of the day, they have great stuff to fill you up for your meal of choice. 

Their menu changes with the seasons since they source locally. So the best thing I would suggest is to look up their menu online before heading down if you like to have an idea of what to order in advance. There hasn't been any item on their menu which I do not like so far, and I have been there more than 15 times in total and still counting. 

Some of their specialties I like include the now-in-season bimbimbap burrito (served during weekend brunch), pork belly buns (appetizer), korean BBQ pork (lunch) and rigatoni & emu meatballs (dinner). Feel free to order whatever that excites you on the menu, they haven't disappoint so far!!

Service has always been excellent for me. I also love how they are so knowledgeable about the menu and so willing to make substitutes for your orders. They really go out of their way to make your dining experience with them as enjoyable as possible. 

They don't take reservations, so as you would expect summer Saturdays will be super busy for them since there is the outdoor farmer's market. If you just happen to be craving some freshly baked pastries or a coffee/tea/lemonade, just stop by their little stall right outside the restaurant. They have awesome croissants, cookies, danishes etc.

So are weekday dinners, yes, even Monday to Thursday too. That goes to show how good and popular Graze is!! My tip would be to go for early lunch )before 11:45 am, or early dinner (before 5:45 pm). Oh wait, now that I openly share my tip, maybe they will start getting a bigger crowd during these 'non-peak' periods ~~~",positive

We got ate around 1 which seemed to be a perfect time- the lunch rush was over!  Our waiter was excellent and very helpful as far as the menu was concerned.  My friend had the blue moon beef which is only available in Wisc- she loved it and wanted to take a case home.  We both ordered the Korean BBQ sandwich.  Heaven in my mouth! It was the perfect balance between spicy and sweet.  Our waiter enticed is with the bourbon pecan pie- again a hit!  Very rich and sweet so it's good we ended up sharing 1 portion!  Now that we've had a taste of Graze... We want more! Next Epic trip will include dinner at Graze.  Btw all their food is locally sourced and tastes like it too!,positive

Server was just wonderful and very knowledgeable about everything on the menu.  The beet salad is an explosion of diverse flavors and textures: sweet beets and figs, buttery crunchy crostini, creamy goat cheese - wow!  Being informed that the Graze Burger won best burger in the U.S. by James Beard, I had to give it a try - it held up to that reputation!",positive

Beautiful view of the Capitol from the dinning room but the large room made for a very loud environment because of the resonance. 

Overall, I had a good visit. Make a visit to this place for good service and fresh food made with local ingredients!",positive
ch484,4/30/2014,revch1312,5,"Graze will always hold a special place in my heart.  I've been there probably more times than I can count, and I have been beyond pleased with my experience every single time.    The views of the capitol through the towering glass windows warrant a visit in and of themselves.  It is about as good of a view as you can get of the capitol from indoors.  Add the view and the overall cool, laid-back atmosphere to a top-notch, eclectic menu, and you have an incredible dining experience that is uniquely Madison.  

Like I said, I've been to Graze a lot, and I've loved everything I've tried.  Menu items change, and all the seasonal menu items that I've tried have wow-ed me.  I have fond memories of a braised beef brisket that simply melted in my mouth.

In terms of the continuous menu items, the Bipimbap my personal favorite.  They let you know it's spicy, and they are NOT lying, but it is also fresh, flavorful, savory, and unlike anything I've ever tried before.  The cheese curds (!!!) are my favorite in Madison.  They're huge, coated in just the right amount of breading, and served alongside a divine ranch sauce.  

The drinks are also commendable.  They're incredibly unique and perfectly mixed (also, NOT weak).  Totally worth the money.

I highly recommend Graze to anyone and everyone, and I've brought almost everyone I care about here at least once (everyone has raved about it, and I have a feeling it wasn't just to make sure I didn't feel bad).

I love you Graze! Always and forever!",positive

The Graze burger packs a lot of flavor, However overall I found my dish to be on the salty side.  The fries has very good mouth feel, but had so much salt that I can't really taste potato. The schnitzel was quite oily. We waited for 1H15min for this meal, it could have been better.",negative
ch484,4/25/2014,revch1314,4,"Defiantly my favorite place for brunch! Some of the highlights include... The beignets, these pillows of love are comparable to those found in New Orleans French Quarter so I've been told. Another notable appetizer is the Sassy Cow cheese curds. A food that we've all had before but done with the finest Wisconsin cheese and battered in a light house made breading, these will be gone in a heart beat. For an entree I would recommend the chicken and waffles which gets some extra pizzaz from the local maple syrup and the seasonal fruit from the farmers market across the street. If you're looking for a hardy breakfast sandwich look no further than the loaded breakfast sandwich. It combines all elements of a wake me up breakfast with bacon, ham, 2 kinds of local cheese, spinach and topped off with a runny egg. Perfection between two pieces of bread.

I could say more but why when you can go and sample some of the amazing eats(all made with local ingredients) for yourself, it's sure to be a great start to your Sunday.",positive

Graze has the BEST mac 'n cheese I've ever come across (to include my own homemade mac). But that's about the only thing I'll ever order there as an entree. Good sides and mac, but otherwise the food and price aren't worth the trip.",negative
ch484,4/21/2014,revch1316,3,"The biggest draw for us was that this restaurant's menu is all local. 

The staff was super friendly and they are very knowledgable about each dish. The restaurant wasn't crowded at all and was perfect for a nice early dinner on the square with some friends.

The cocktails were good. We each had a different one from the menu. Nothing super yummy so we all just ordered one. 

The apps were alright. We had the pretzel with the best creamy cheese you could ever have and some other mustard spreads. Then the pickle platter which was interesting but I'm sure a pickle connoisseur would have loved it! 

Our friends ordered the Mac N' Cheese and the Toasted Farro. My partner and I had the pub burger and a Fried chicken and waffle.

Our friends said they liked their meals but didn't say much else. My partner thought her burger was good and the fries were okay. My fried chicken and waffle were good but again nothing phenomenal. I've had better waffles at IHOP and fried chicken from Church's chicken to say the least.

Again since everything is local - you are paying top dollar for a little bit of food. When the food doesn't seem fantastic then you leave thinking ""Wow, we could have had a more savory meal at home for half of the money.""

ch484,4/16/2014,revch1317,2,"Gosh, I so want to love this place. The magic coffee is, well, magical.The space is lovely and the staff is terrific. But the menu is lame, and so are the renderings of the few things I would want to eat. They try too hard to be clever or ""hipsterish"", throwing good culinary sense out the window.
For example, the burger. They manage to really screw this up to the point that I wonder if they have a vegetarian from some other exotic country who has never even had a  hamburger, much less a great one. A million dollar restaurant should be putting out a burger that people drive for 200 miles to eat. Their attempts at Asian food make me think they have a vegetarian from, well , the midwest, who has never tasted the way these things ought to taste. I come here from time to time to enjoy the wondrous space and am confounded by the utter lack of anything worth ordering, and when I do, I'm consistently underwhelmed by the flavors.",negative
ch484,4/16/2014,revch1318,3,"Went for lunch today...nice high ceiling restaurant with an open floor plan.  Wasn't packed but the hostess wouldn't want to give me a table.  I was first offered a bar seat, I asked for a table, then offered a high table seat although there were tables open.  No biggie maybe she was expecting a crowd that never came because tables were open when I left.  
Pork buns - had better like at Ippudo in NYC or even Lucky Belly in Honolulu.  The steamed buns came out mushy, not sure if they were made wrong or the day from the pork made them soggy. 

Sandwich/soup combo - Chicken chipotle soup was the best of the three.  Nice hot soup on a cold day was nice.  It was tasty and had tortilla chips in it. 

- Hot Italian beef sandwich, haven't had an authentic Italian beef sand before but it just tasted off.  

The waiter was attentive and was honest with recommendations.  I like the fact he left a pitcher of water to give me the option of self refill, but I never had to as he came by every time to top it off.   

Full bar with a decent selection of local beers.  Elected to skip this time cause I had an empty stomach and think I was already dehydrated and getting a headache.",negative
ch484,4/10/2014,revch1319,5,"Graze is my favorite local gastropub. It's a great place to take just about anyone--they have dressed-up and dressed-down options, and they can adjust their menu to accommodate everything from veganism to gluten intolerance. Plus, half the dinner menu changes every month or two, so you can go back repeatedly and not see the same things. The other half of the dinner menu stays put, so you have some go-tos if you aren't into options accompanied by root vegetable puree. It can get a little pricey, but there are also cheaper options, so it works out. 

Some of my favorites include the Graze burger and the bibimbap (a spicy Korean dish that's basically meat or tofu + veggies + rice), both of which are on the perennial menu. For appetizers, you can't beat the cheese curds, but the deviled eggs and popcorn sure try. And for dessert, treat yourself to some milk and cookies. They take a bit because they fresh bake them, and they're worth every minute of the wait. 

Besides dinner, Graze has a decadent brunch menu (Nutella French toast, anyone?) and an inventive drinks menu that changes often. They also locally source everything they can.",positive
ch484,4/5/2014,revch1320,4,"The best chocolate chip cookies, hot out of the oven, takes 20 min to make - cannot be beat. 
Drinks - A big plus, great bartender, standard fare well done. 
Food - I would give the food '3 stars'. I think it is good and I will go back but not something I miss sooo much that I need to go there. That might also be because I went there way too many times last year. 
It looks all fancy and all from outside, but prices are decent and the wait is no more than 30 mins most days; and if you go later you can sit down easily, especially in small groups.

Try it, and you won't regret it. It really is magical. I've been here on two different locations, once during the summer and again during the winter. The menu is seasonal so they are constantly switching things up. 

Their pretzel is delicious. Salty because of the excess rock salt found on the pretzel, but delicious. 

I got their beet salad in the summer with some cheddar and mixed greens. Beets and cheddar... who would have thought the combination of the two would be so delicious? 

In the winter, I ordered their bibimbap... which was an interesting experience. I'm Korean, born and raised in Los Angeles where the  Korean population is HUGE. Having said this, having fried rice (literally fried) with ground pork in my bibimbap was a new experience. It wasn't bad, actually it was quite good. I should warn you though, the gochuchang (the red pepper paste) is spicy. Like burn your tongue, I need a giant glass of milk spicy. It starts off sweet, but it'll build faster than you think and leave your mouth on fire.

But really, the cheese curds are amazing, as is everything else I've eaten for brunch there.  I've gone the sweet route and the savory route and never been disappointed.  My favorite part is the list of local providers on the back. I love knowing that Graze supports Wisconsin farmers and food producers.  Check it out. You won't be disappointed!",positive
ch484,3/26/2014,revch1325,4,"I was feeling indecisive amongst my Madison bookmarks and proferred the wife to make a selection amongst my selections. I hardly had to spit out the word Graze and its connotations before she made that her choice. I didn't complain; a bit of homework led me to understand that Graze is run by a Bearded chef. That's Beard, as in James Beard. Shaken, not stirred.

Graze sits a modest, modernist glass case of emotion directly across from the Capitol. It's connected to its sister restaurant, the starry-eyed named L'Etoile. The view from either is quite spectacular.

Of course, a place that calls itself Graze screams farm to table, though exactly what farms are left unclear by the menu. The menu, like the chef-owner, has a Korean slant to it, with Wisconsin farm overtones. It also has a $21 burger purported to be one of the best in America.

It is perhaps unfair that I had just eaten the best burger in Chicago, the meticulously simple concoction at Au Cheval. So, and especially for a Jackson plus Washington, there was barely a chance for Graze's burger to equate. Graze's burger is good, and there are parts that are great--the tangy caramelized onions, the delicious on-the-side aioli, and the wonderful fried egg I stole from my wife's bibimbap bowl.

Here's where it falls short. The first is the at times delicious and at other times overtly sour-acidic patty. It's a combination of bacon, sirloin, ground beef, and short rib, and if you just drooled on your phone or computer screen a little, it's OK. That all sounds as mouth-watering as it should, but the patty was a little too big, didn't hold together well enough, and was splashed with just too much Worcestershire-cabernet jus, killing the proper taste of the meat. The second is the fact that the burger plain done fell apart, whether from too much jus, too much meat, or my daft idea that a stolen fried egg would be the cherry on top. Burgers. Shouldn't. Fall. Apart. Period. (And if they do, as in they are meant to, you had better dang well wrap the sucker in white paper first.)

Extremely high expectations for the burger aside, the meal went really well. The cheese curds, a delicacy we had to order, this being Wisconsin and all, were fantastic. Special kudos to the house ranch that tasted a mite like tartar sauce, a plus for me. The pickle board was also a great deal of fun, with six different pickled plates ranging from kimchi to beets in a citrus vinaigrette. Yes, kimchi--remember the Korean thing. 

As we hadn't had Korean food during our duration in Chicago, now approaching eight months, the wife narrowed in on the bibimbap bowl. The gochujang and its spiciness set her back a bit, but the bowl was chock full of fresh, delicious vegetables and marvelous blocks of crispy fried rice. Even at its price point, the bibimbap was tasty and impressive.

Too full for dessert, I'll call the night here. Graze is a great space with charming, inviting decor and a solid wait staff. If the burger had been mindblowingly good and worth the price tag, this would be a five-star review. But like I said, it was a high bar to reach, and a fantastic meal nonetheless.",positive
ch484,3/25/2014,revch1326,3,"Been here twice and I just don't see ""why all the fuss?"" Many people want to blame my lactose and non-beef issue, but there are so many other great restaurants in Madison that easily remove those items, and I can still eat like a fat cat. I've been for both brunch and dinner now. 

Brunch - got the chicken and waffles - meh. The chicken was average breading and bland to slightly salt taste. The waffle was ok as well, nothing that makes me want to come back. But it did sustain my hunger for a couple of hours (portion size was decent).

Dinner - I ordered the beet burger b/c they couldn't even fathom changing out ingredients to fit my diet issues. I found this interesting from the restaurant of the top chef, in Madison, a foodie-wannabe town. They gave me a gluten free menu, and the only dairy-free (and gluten-free) items were beef or pork....or this horrible beet burger. So I got the pub burger, can't do beef, so a friend said the beet-walnut burger was good. Didn't like the sound of it, but gave it a whirl. So I've been a fan of walnut burgers every since I found the ""General Store"" in Kettle Morraine (south division). But this is not a walnut-beet burger.... this is a beet-walnut burger. HEAVY on the beets, and not that yummy vinegar soaked kind. All you taste is dirt, that earthy gritty dirt, like you just pulled the beet out of the ground and started chomping. I think the walnut in there is just to add thickness, but there was no walnut flavor that night. Even my friend who suggested it, ordered it, and wasn't a fan (that night?) either. 

I also tried the oysters - very good, and 3 different ones to chose from, although it took some persuasion to get my 1/2 dozen to be ALL one kind? (never had to argue for this). 

Tasted the bone marrow and pulled pork - bone marrow was goo, but the pork tasted nice - decent BBQ sauce, shredded good, but more sauce than pork (I come from a Q state and grew up on it).

Also tasted the mussel's sauce - spicier than I was expecting. Not sure if I had ordered that I could have finished it without taking a few breaks or a glass of (faux) milk! My dinner friend who ordered it said the mussels were cooked good. 

One other thing that bothered me and some others in the 9 person group: our group is split men and women, we haven't seen each other in a couple of months, we're all standing at the bar, saying our hellos, and then trying to get drinks. I wait about 5 minutes to get noticed and another 3-5 min to get the drink. I'm half way into my drink and my party starts moving around, grumbling. The host or someone had asked us to leave the area and wait in the lobby/hallway/foyer. We hadn't even had time to get ""rowdy"" (not that we are that type of group anyway)! The rationale: we were taking up too much space? We were as pressed against the bar as we could be, I was on the outside of the group, and there was still at least 2 feet from us to the person sitting at a table. Maybe this is a code, but the staff didn't give warning first? Here I am holding a $9 drink, knowing 9 x 9 = $81 (plus the few some of the early members had), thinking is this how you wanna lose money? the big group? really? Did they send someone to check on us? nope. 

The rest of the dinner group (8 others) were split about loving it or thinking it was ""eh, good.""

Overall, not very friendly for large groups nor for dietary restricted people, unless you just love a plain ol' $21 beef burger? Only 2 main dish vegan items - the beet burger was one, and some darn hash is the other (the seasoning there comes from kim chee, which I like, but come on! a hash!?) Haven't been to a nice Madison place without a fish on the menu or ppl willing to work with the chicken item in a while. Sorry to those who love this place, but I won't be ""grazing"" there any time soon.",negative
ch484,3/13/2014,revch1327,5,"I had the smoked beet salad, which was made with Door County tart cherries, radicchio, some orange pieces, and roasted walnuts.

I ordered the Graze burger. I was expecting fireworks for $21 & the claim ""best burger"".

The Graze Burger was the soggiest and most expensive burger I've ever eaten. The meat patty was tasty. However the garnishing made the bread very soggy and unpleasant to eat. I was hungry and not in the mood to wait any longer for my food. 

 Perhaps I need to explore the menu a bit more",negative
ch484,3/6/2014,revch1330,5,"An amazing farm to table restaurant that  is extremely affordable. Food that comes from so close just tastes better, everything we had didn't disappoint. 

-Beet and Walnut Pub Burger with a side salad yummy wow. 

-roasted seasonal veggies, you can taste the freshness 

-bimtami or whatever was sooo good. Crispy rice. Get the spicy sauce on the side and add in yourself. 

-YOU MUST GET THE CHEESE CURDS. YOU WILL REGRET IT FOR LIFE IF YOU DONT.",positive
ch484,3/3/2014,revch1331,2,"My review stars probably aren't really fair.  Tonight I took my boys to Graze and I was so excited to let them enjoy the view and have a nice dinner.  The burgers are amazing but I ordered the chicken and waffle.  It was horrible.  I didn't eat it and hoped my waiter would ask if there was something wrong with it.  But he didn't so I paid $16 for a dinner I did not enjoy at all.  My boys liked the waffle and I left the chicken.  It was dry and seemingly over cooked.

I still like the place.  Love the popcorn and I think the burgers are great but the chicken and waffles stink.",negative
ch484,2/28/2014,revch1332,5,"This is a great location right on the Capitol Square in Madison.  At night, the view of the Capitol building through the windows is beautiful.  Even the great pictures on other reviews of this restaurant don't do it justice.  

I started with some fine Wisconsin craft beer: the Ale Asylum Hopalicious.  It was outstanding with the Graze cheese curds.  This was the first time I've tried this local favorite and it was a great pairing.  The main course was a delicious braised beef with spinach, a cabernet wine sauce, mashed potoatoes, and onion straws.  Simple, but perfect.  Dessert was a hickory nut pie with house-made vanilla ice cream.  This was the best of many very good meals that I had in Madison.  

The service was friendly, knowledgeable, and prompt.  I will definitely be back when I return to this great town.",positive

ch484,2/20/2014,revch1334,5,"We went here before the end of 2013 and had a wonderful evening out. We hit up Graze for my significant others birthday and we were very glad with our choice. Having gone out on a Friday night, I knew there would be a wait but I also knew that Graze utilizes a website that will allow you to see where you are on the wait-list. We put our names in, and headed down the corner to grab a beer at a not-soo packed bar while we waited. When we saw that our names were soon on the list, we headed back to Graze. We were seated at one of the front tables that overlook the capital. I had a fantastic drink-I believe it was the ""Keep your gin up"" and the birthday boy had a take on a Moscow mule. I'm not a big meat eater, but I couldn't help but enjoy the bites of the Graze burger that were shared with me. The meat was seared perfectly on the burger and the onions were caramelized to perfection with just the right amount of sweetness to them. I ordered the bibimbap and didn't regret my decision there either. The crispy rice was amazing in contrast to the egg and the spicy sauce that it came with. We had been to Graze in the spring of 2013, and the trip we took at the end of 2013 completely surpassed the first visit in every way possible. The staff was prompt, courteous, and made great recommendations.",positive
ch484,2/8/2014,revch1335,5,"Delicious!  Their food is absolutely amazing and out of this world.  I have never been disappointed with a drink or menu item.  They also have a lot of fun 5-course specialty dinners.  The wait can be long at times, but they will call your cell phone when your table is ready.  Brunch is my favorite!  They may have the best Bloody Mary in town!",positive
ch484,2/8/2014,revch1336,4,"I really like Graze. I've been a couple times now - once for dinner and once for drinks - and both times I was impressed by their excellent service. Oh, and the view of the capitol is AWESOME! Prices are just fine, especially for such a swanky-feeling place. I go here when I want to feel fancy but don't want to feel broke afterward. It's classy but quite down to earth - a good combo.

The only thing is that I actually haven't been super impressed with is their food. When I went for dinner, my companion and I both agreed that our dishes weren't really anything special. I will probably return to confirm - maybe it was just what we ordered. 

But for drinks, I would say that if you're entertaining guests to Madison, this would be the spot to go.",positive
ch484,2/7/2014,revch1337,5,"Fantastic concept, exceptional food, friendly wait staff, and clean, simple decor. We had a fantastic experience at Graze, so much so that over the course of a weekend, my friends and I wound up going twice in 2 days. As a UW alumni, I was thrilled that Madison gained such a great restaurant in a prime location. We made friends with a particular bartender who was true WI friendly (ah, home-state pride) and introduced us to beautiful drinks like The Magic Bullet... Graze's Magic Coffee plus bourbon. Instant friendship. Brunch was amazing - boast-worthy cheese curds, corned beef hash, kielbasa, and noodle bowl. Graze impressed the foodie out of towners of our group, and I am planning on making sure I stop by each time I'm back in Madison. U Ra Ra!",positive
ch484,2/2/2014,revch1338,5,"Saturday night I was there with three friends. It was fabulous. I've dined there a number of times and have always had an exceptional experience. The ambiance is a wonderful combination of Madison, big city and très chic local dining spot. The food is delicious, fresh, well prepared and imaginative without being over the top. The frosting on the cake is the outstanding service. Taylor, our server was very knowledgeable, friendly, relates well to her clients well, professional, confident without being cocky and efficient. She significantly enhanced the experience without over shading it. I look forward to another experience here again, soon.",positive
ch484,2/2/2014,revch1339,3,"For all the hype that preceded this place, I was somewhat let down. I definitely enjoyed my meal, and the service was absolutely stellar in all aspects (efficiency, speed, friendliness, and helpfulness), but the food wasn't as good as I hoped. 

As far as the menu is concerned, there is plenty of choice, whether you are a foodie or more of a traditionalist. The pork belly buns were really flavorful and tasty, as were the cheese curds. Fried chicken and waffles were okay, but the seasonal fish dish was a pathetic portion for the price. Probably four ounces of fish on a half cup of rice for $30. Taste was above average, but at that price I expected either a bigger portion or delicious flavor. 

Best entree was probably sweet potato pancakes. A really tasteful blend of sweet (cherry sauce, glazed walnuts, and sweet potatoes) along with salty/savory fried egg and some potatoes.",negative
ch484,2/1/2014,revch1340,4,"I came here because another restaurant's server and I discussed Corned Beef Hash and where to go.  My husband is serious about his hash so I had to take him here.  We were seated immediately and had an excellent view of everything.  I decided to order up some beignets for a starter along with some grapefruit juice.  The juice was spot on.  Not too tart and not too sweet.  The beignets reminded me of how much I missed Cafe Du Monde in New Orleans.  Very tasty but not an exact to the southern restaurant.  Our brunch choices were chicken & waffle (never had so I  thought to try it) and the corned beef hash.  The corned beef hash was served with two eggs over easy and we chose wheat toast.  Thee toast was too tough but the corned beef hash tasted great so we just ignored the bread.  The hash had awesome amounts of corned beef and the vegetables that were added really peaked the flavor.  The way they cooked it on the grill top gave a little bit of a sear which allowed the beef to be a little nutty flavored.  Though the eggs we got were a tad overcooked, we still had a little yolk to enjoy with the hash.  

The chicken was beautifully fried and very moist inside.  The waffle had a great cinnamon butter and it really allowed the fluffy goodness come through.  Personally, I don't understand the WOW factor of having chicken with waffles...though both tasted great I feel that I don't need to have both together again.  
All in all, I'll be back and I can't wait to try the cocktails and lunch or dinner menu.",positive
ch484,2/1/2014,revch1341,4,"This is a great place to relax with friends, enjoy some drinks and some really good food.

The food here is pretty good. And they make really good drinks. But my favorite aspect of Graze is the view. The entire building is essentially glass windows and you can sit in the restaurant and enjoy great views of the Capitol. 

The wait when we arrived was about 25 minutes, which wasn't too bad for seven o'clock on a week night. We ended up sitting at the bar and sharing three appetizers. The soft pretzel, deviled eggs and the bread basket. I really wanted a mojito, which wasn't on the menu but the bartender gladly made one for me. It was easily the best mojito I had had in a while. Can't remember the last time my mojito was made with brown sugar. If you can't already tell, I really enjoyed that drink.

For dinner, I had the sweet potato pancakes. I was able to enjoy the breakfast comfort food but it also really felt very appropriate for dinner. The pancakes were coupled with a sunny side up egg and vegetable hash. The entire meal was just perfectly suited for the beautiful environment. 

This is a must visit AGAIN. Enjoy Graze!",positive
ch484,1/28/2014,revch1342,4,"I've been coming to Graze for a couple of years  and I always find something interesting on the menu.  I don't want to give a glowing review that everything is always wonderful because some things I think are just OK, others are pretty good, and a few items I really like!

Some things I rate as OK but nothing special: the Biscuits and gravy at brunch and Roasted Bone marrow

Some things are pretty good: Noodle bowl

Some things are really good:  Bibimbap burrito, Corned Beef Hash, Roasted Beets, Artisan Cheese board

Great ambiance.  I love sitting at the bar and the dining room gives off a really nice vibe.

I didn't think the Popcorn share plate was that great, but the Pickle Board has some great pickled items, super unique and very good. The Graze Burger is a must. I was put off by the description in the menu, as it seemed to be a monstrosity, but order it anyway and it was the perfect size to eat, and absolutely excellent.

I've been to Madison 3 times for work and I always make a stop at the Graze for the ""Graze Burger"" - $22. The patty is always moist and flavorful. The side of fries is also great with the aioli sauce. With a few glasses of beer, it will leave your tummy smiling. They have happy hour where you get a buy one, get one off their beer selection. I tried a few, but my favorite beer there is the Potosi Snake Hollow. When I was at the bar, I was told that the chef also works at the L'Etoile restaurant which is very high end. So expect the Graze to have that top quality food for reasonable prices. The service is amazing! They make be slower during rush hour, but when they do stop by, they are always very friendly. When I hear that my coworkers are heading to Madison for work, I always recommend a stop at the Graze for dinner! The next time I am at Madison, I'll be sure to stop by again!",positive

The hostess also suggested we could visit Graze's sister restaurant L'Etoile just across the entryway for a drink at the bar while we waited for a table (which we did). 

We were seated right by the window and had a view of the capital building, which was beautifully lit up.  I got an appetizer of fried pickles - they were chips, not spears, and the batter was light and crispy.  I ordered the pulled pork mac and cheese.  The pulled pork on top was good, but the bites I had with just the mac and cheese were really the best.  Others at my table ordered burgers (the Graze Burger and the Pub Burger), they looked decadent and my friends said they were very good.",positive

I went to Graze for dinner on my birthday and coincidentally and happily got the same waitress, Mickey (Mickie?), as the time I came about a month ago with two friends. Yay! She's so so nice and easy to talk to. She knows her stuff about the food, too.

Derek (my fiancé) and I started off with a potato/creamy goat cheese dish. OMG. After we finished the potatoes, there was still all this perfectly good goat cheese left, so we ordered the most. amazing. breadbasket. ever., and had a blast. The funniest part was, while waiting for the breadbasket to come, 3 different people came to pick up the goat cheese dish. We'd tell them, ""Oh, actually, we want that as dip for our bread,"" and every one of them said something along the lines of ""Genius."" And it was, my friends, it was. ALWAYS ORDER THE BREADBASKET.

Derek got the bibimbap dish with the pork. He's been sick with a cold that traveled up to his nose so it was hard for him to taste things, but he still loved this. Ate it all up. Loved the veggies to help make the cold go away, too!

I decided to go crazy and get the Hook's mac 'n cheese. I'm so happy I did. A waiter suggested a bit of Sriracha and that was just as genius as the bread + goat cheese. With all the bread I ate, I couldn't finish the mac 'n cheese, but that just meant that I had majestic leftovers.

We ordered dessert after this too. My cheesecake fell a little flat, but I think I was just too full to enjoy it.

I loved the space at night. These windows are amazing. They make it feel so cozy at night, with candles all around. I love the lighting at the bar. I just love this place.",positive
ch484,12/21/2013,revch1351,2,"I wish I hadn't eaten at L'Etoile; my expectations were set way too high. The food was spotty (tasty egg dishes, overly salty salad, heavy beignets), but it was the service that was most disappointing. The wait staff appeared to have too many tables, as tables weren't turned over quickly, and there were long spells between refills or check-ins. The hostesses were probably the worst though; grossly inaccurate waiting time estimates, fibs about having called cells and a general unfriendly attitude. 

If I didn't know for a fact this was related to the best restaurant in town, I wouldn't believe it.

The beer and drink lists are so vast, you could spend your entire 45-minute wait for a table just deciding what to have; I had an old fashioned well made enough to rival those of Graze's eponymous down-the-block neighbor. 

The menu was less vast, but everything looked so good it took just as long to decide. A pretzel seems so simple, but makes for an incredible appetizer when surrounded by Graze's house made dipping sauces. For dinner, I went for the Graze burger; I've been dreaming about it nightly ever since.

I had fried pickles, cheese curds, and a beet salad and I would be a happy camper to return here and eat again. Bonus: they have wine on tap which is always a good thing in my opinion.

The building is glass so you can see inside. Hip would be a good word to describe it. Also, fun and tasty after eating there. 

The hostess took my name and phone number, utilizing a text system to alert us when our table was ready. All of 5 minutes later we sat down. 

The menu has local, fresh, seasonal, and more varied options available. I had the bi bim bop to quell a craving, and my friends had the beet salad, burger, and a pasta dish. All were quickly delivered to our table by our friendly waitress and consumed without much chatter or comment other than 'yum'. We shared a crisp at the end- perfect conclusion to the meal.

I've had much better food for the price in many establishes around the Capital. 
I do strongly appreciate how much they are supporting the surrounding Madison Area food (for that a solid 3 out of 5 stars), but I was a bit let down with the production of what I have received in my orders. 

The menu is unique for sure, finding some really cool Madison area alternative eating's, but just be ready to expect that your ordering unique so what they will be bringing you might now be up your ally if your similar to a country boy like me who wants a big old bar burger (grease me up!) loaded up. 
It's hard to screw up a cheeseburger, and I think they may have totally messed it up pretty bad the last time I was there. I'm just not a fan of an English Muffin as a bun for a burger. 

They are a popular place that does not take reservations, so be prepared to wait to be seated. but if your lucky, you will get to sit in a huge booth or nice table, definitely, a great date place with huge place windows over looking Madison at it's finest.

ch484,11/17/2013,revch1358,5,"This is by far my favorite restaurant in Madison. 

There is always different seasonal options but nine times out of ten i go for the burger.  it is a bit pricey for a burger in Madison (21 bucks) but It is out of this world...especially when paired with a nice Cabernet Sauvignon.

The baked to order cookie is also amazing!!

The food is locally sourced and I always feel good about eating here.

The brunch is good as well but they don't change the items on the menu often other than the daily scrambles. The French toast stuffed with Nutella is very good.

The service has always been spot on.  Just last friday, my fiance made the mistake of ordering a beer without sampling it and the waiter insisted she replace it with something else.

We were in town for only 4 days, and I insisted that we needed to try some fried cheese curd.  Strangely I was never a fan of cheese sticks, but I have to say I sometimes day dream about the fried cheese curd I had at Graze.  My mouth waters thinking about it.  

Graze is local, organic, and sustainable! Yay!  It is also situated across from the capitol building in downtown Madison.  In the evening, the capitol building lights up and creates a beautiful backdrop, which adds to the atmosphere.

Unfortunately I only tried the fried cheese curds.  I'll have to explore the menu more the next time I visit.",positive
ch484,11/9/2013,revch1361,3,"Ok, ok.  It is local.  It is homemade.  I get it. 

Now the food itself?  It is just ordinary.  It is tasty and good but it is not worth the hype or the wait.  The restaurant does not take reservations.  As a first time diner, it would have been nice to know we could have left our name, ran an errand, received a text and then made our way back.  Instead we had to sit in the drafty entry way.  I was cold for forty minutes waiting for dinner.  

We got seated in a great booth.  It was just my husband and I.  I felt guilty because larger parties got passed up.  Nonetheless, it was cozy and very comfortable.  We decided to try the Fried Gnudi.  This is essentially a fancy cheese curd.  It was delicious.  It tastes like a bread stick without bread.  It would have been nice to know what they were.  Instead, we were told they were ricotta like gnocchi.  As a gnocchi eater, I can assure you they were nothing like gnocchi.  

Now dinner.  I tried the Mac and Cheese.  I was a bit disappointed.  I do not like strong cheddar.  I asked the waitress whether the cheese had a strong flavor.  Her response?  No, the aged cheddar was a smoky taste that comes out when the cheese is cooked.  I took a chance.  It was beautifully served.  It is a very rich meal.  It is very cheesy and creamy.  However, the cheese taste itself?  It was incredibly strong.  I was not happy with it.  I was told the completely wrong thing.  The portion is also small for $9.  I was kind of upset by this.  

We also ordered the pub burger.  We shared each other these meals.  The burger was cooked well but it was a small patty.  It was served on an English muffin.  I am assuming it was homemade.  It was so dense and lacked any type of lightness I have had with other English muffins.  

The star of the meal?  The fries with garlic aoli.  Hands down.  Magnificent.  

The food was not terrible.  It was good, average food.  The service was good.  The people were nice.  Graze is just not worth all the hype.  Nope.",negative
ch484,11/7/2013,revch1362,3,"I have not lived in Madison for almost a decade, but I always enjoyed L'etoile and the little cafe downstairs from the old space where they served fabulous little sandwiches to take back to my desk at the Capitol. So I was excited to try Graze, which is in a soaring space with nice views of the square. 

 We hit Madison just before dinner time, so we ordered from the more limited menu, but there were still plenty of good options. We ordered the pork buns, which were a pretty serviceable knock off of David Chang's Momofuku pork buns, but the slices of pork belly were a little on the skinny side, and I lost the umami hit of a thicker, glistening belly.  We also ordered the cheese curds and deviled eggs as appetizers, both of which were good. The cheese curds were reminiscent of the old Town Talk diner in Minneapolis, and were a little too plentiful for two people but would work for a group. The deviled eggs were a touch mustardy. 

If we had stopped there, I think we would have come away pretty happy, but since we had skipped breakfast and lunch, we ordered the pub burger. Mistake. I was expecting a gastropub-style burger, something thicker and that would showcase the local beef. It turned out that it was basically a slider-style WI bar burger. We ordered it medium rare, but you basically can't cook a thin burger anything less than medium well. The burger was hard and dry, with flavors redolent of sawdust. My wife commented that it left her mouth devoid of saliva. I am sure a local, organic cow began the life cycle of this burger, but you would never know based on the hockey puck outcome. 

I love and support farm to table, and I would come here again to try other dishes, but I would avoid the burger like the plague. Given the quality of the inputs that Graze has, I would expect a little more.",negative

I had the Hot Sugar Baby craft cocktail, a slightly spicy, not too sweet margarita, it was delicious. Everyone loved their drinks. 

As far as food goes, I had the Bibimbap with pork which was spicy, crunchy, and full of veggies-definitely crave worthy! Then fresh out of the oven cookies and milk to finish off the night.

Atmosphere was fun... Sat out on the patio and enjoyed people watching of the people coming and going to the state capital. Great place!!! :-)",positive
ch484,10/27/2013,revch1367,5,"Been here a few times now and it is always a great experience. The Magic Coffee is a must! All of the brunch items look delicious, you really can't go wrong. The beet salad is also pretty much amazing, and I am not a beet lover at all. I've only been for breakfast but plan to go back for dinner sometime! Service is always fantastic. 

 One negative- the cocktails are overpriced. $8 for a bloody mary is a little steep no matter how good it is.",positive
ch484,10/21/2013,revch1368,4,"I have been here for lunch twice and brunch once. Both lunches I have had the same dish--the smoked tofu wrap. I think there might be other vegan-friendly ones on the menu but I can't be sure. Anyway, the wrap is very good, even when you get it vegan with mustard instead of mayo. They do something to the tofu that makes it authentically smoky and delicious. Other than the wow factor of the tofu the rest of the meal is very much good but not great. But that's kind of Graze's deal--basic food done well with a consistent locavore ethic. 

Brunch was much better than lunch, however. The scrambled tofu ranks high, even though as a vegan in Madison I am a little sick of that being my only option at most places for brunch. Regardless, it is very good (the sauce was spicy and savory and oh so-delicious). It was served with an abundant bed of fresh greens with a simple and satisfying vinaigrette. The potatoes, were the stars of the meal, however (as they are with all breakfast dishes done proper). Very crispy and salty. 

I paired this with a local craft brew (some kind of Rye APA). 

Graze is a standby in my eating out rotation. It is fancy enough to go for a business lunch, yet laid back enough to take your mom out for a nice brunch.  Their food is simple but tasty. And in a foodie-centric culture where excess and experimentation are sometimes a little overpowering, that's a good thing.",positive
ch484,10/19/2013,revch1369,4,"Beautiful restaurant, delicious food, and super yummy craft cocktails! Stopped here for entrees during a progressive dinner. The place was packed. Neat text message system letting you know your table is ready. No gross, filthy pager system. The hostess was a little frazzled as the other customers around us were incredibly rude. The bar service was a little slow but was wonderful once we got someone's attention. Our actual server was wonderful. Very personable and offered wonderful suggestions. My friend had the pork chops...huge portion! I had the gnocchi and it was absolutely delicious. It was light and just the right amount of food. I would definitely recommend this establishment to a friend!",positive

The location and ambiance are awesome. You can see the Capitol through the gorgeous windows while you nosh on yummy food.
The burger was perfection! Well cooked and tasty, the perfect combination.
The Sauteed Gnocchi was mouthwatering FANTASTIC!
The dessert was a sorbet mixture of raspberry and aronia berry. FABULOUS.
I will definitely be back!",positive

But oh! that is a delicious sauce. I understand it changes seasonally, and were I closer, I'd get it every time it changed because I'm sure it'd be fantastic every time. The perfect dish to split after the cheese-fest that is the farmer's market across the way.",positive

I loved the patty; it tasted good and you could actually taste the beet root. The english muffin as the bun was not a great idea; i think a typical bun would be the best idea still. 

I also got their popcorn which the waiter said was the best popcorn he has ever had and it honestly kind of sucked. It was basically small popcorn with cheese sprinkled on top of it. I personally would not recommend the popcorn",positive

ch484,10/10/2013,revch1374,5,"After moving to the Madison area, one place was recommended to my husband and I more then any where else - Graze. We had an opportunity to check it out while I was downtown for a work event this past summer. It did not disappoint. 

We started off with the cheesecurds. They were excellent! Best we have had in Madison - we can say that honestly as we had had cheese curds at two other places just the week before. :) 

We paired them with beer of course. I went with a light brew, my husband got the stout. They were both great. My husband liked the beer but was disappointed with the head on his beer, when the server asked and my husband relayed his disappointment the server offered to replace the beer. Great service! 

Ordered burgers, again, they came highly recommended. They did not disappoint. The aioli was to die for.  

The atmosphere is open and urban. I wouldn't bring my kids, but there were kids there. Pricing is right on...I don't feel I need to say more, when a restaurant is this on point the stars speak for themselves!",positive
ch484,10/7/2013,revch1375,4,"First time visitors this last weekend.  I've heard good things and we finally decided to give it a try. 

It was busy and there was a 30-45 minute wait for a table.  Since going out to dinner for me means relaxing, not rushing and going with the flow the wait wasn't an issue and there were two open seats at the bar, perfect.

It took a minute or two for a bartender to come over, which gave me time to eye over the specialty drinks.  As a huge fan of gin, ginger and lemon - the sweet lou seemed right up my alley.  Unfortunately they were out of the ginger honey, disappointment.  I tried it with regular honey and not so impressed.  I'd like to try it again when they have all the ingredients in stock. 

Once seated at our table, the service was FAST.  We ordered the fried pickles, they came to our table faster than I was expecting.  We loved them!

I ordered the pub burger with a beet and walnut patty.  I've always been a little mixed on beets to begin with but as a vegetarian, I like to try new things.  Not my best choice, still not a fan of beets.  The beet flavor was too overwhelming for me, I took about half the burger off the bun and that seemed to really make a difference for me.  

We will return, I won't order the beet burger - but I look forward to trying some other dishes.",positive
ch484,10/4/2013,revch1376,5,"Truly a gem in the heart of downtown Madison! It lived up to the reviews! The cheese curds were amazing as promised, with a delicious batter.

I rarely give five stars and am happy to be able to do so!",positive

The service was excellent, food was great. The prices were astonishing!! The view of the capital at sunset was amazing sitting on the patio on a warm summer night. Almost too perfect to be true but it was true. I have recommended this restaurant to many people that have asked about a restaurant to go to in Madison. It definitely was farm to table!! For two with all of the food we consumed and drinks we spent about $100.00. In Chicago our dinner would have been over $175.00 if not more!",positive
ch484,8/30/2013,revch1380,4,"Sweet mother of fried cheese curds, this place is good.

With a heavy heart & thick blood, I waddled my way into Graze attempting to keep my heart pumping with all of the cheese flowing through my body. Everywhere you go in Madison you have to try the cheese.

I had had some fried cheese curd mishaps. I'm talking about freeze-dried pre-fried sad mistakes for cheese curds. Graze doesn't pull their curds out of a bag and re-fry them. They are most certainly hand-breaded and they might even say a prayer over them before they serve them to you.

Delicious.

We came in for lunch expecting to try the crazy-expensive Graze Burger on a friends recommendation... only to find that it's a dinner-only offering.

Anger.

After deciding not to leave (we almost did), I turned my attention to the breakfast portion of our menu and snagged the Loaded Breakfast Sandwich. While it was no Graze Burger (continued anger), it was a tasty bronze medal (the silver medal was the cheese curds).

The only other thing I had was wonderful but had a bit of a menu snag.

The ""Magic Coffee"" was actually quite tasty. It was a bit pricey at $4.50 (it had to be more iced coffee than espresso, and cinnamon and half-and-half aren't exactly the most expensive ingredients). What really annoyed me was that they had no secondary pricing option for a refill. The cup wasn't the biggest thing in the world, and charging $4.50 for a second helping is just plain terrible restaurant management.

They have to be tossing in 15% or less of the $4.50 ticket price in ingredient costs, so it's silly to use the same pricing on a second glass.

Fix that, Graze. I'd recommend charging $2 or $2.50 for a second glass.

To sum it up: great food at a decent price, but the menu is too restricting. I hope they listen.",positive
ch484,8/23/2013,revch1381,5,"Updated:  Still love this place.  I've been for Brunch, dinner and late night snacks and have never had a bad meal.

(+) We stopped by after seeing staff dragging a stocked Graze wagon away from the farmer's market. Good sign. 

(+) Atmosphere: The building has tons of natural light and great views of the square. The place was very busy but staff was friendly and our server was very helpful and genuine. They had a couple of specials (don't bother telling me about tofu, I'm a meat eater), both interesting food and drinks and a healthy mix of patrons (none of that pretentious hipsters only garbage). 

(++) Food: We had amazing Bloody Mary specials (pickle and pepper infused vodka, yum!) each served with a Spotted Cow chaser and olive and cheese curd skewer. My boyfriend ordered the pork shoulder ramen bowl and I had eggs Benedict. Both were very well-executed, nothing too fancy.

ch484,8/14/2013,revch1384,3,"Given Graze's association with L'Etoile, we had high hopes. But there were some things that fell short. First, our server lacked knowledge of the menu. We asked about the sweetness level of different cocktails and he said he did not know, without offering to get the opinion of the bartender. We asked about his preferences between different dishes and he said that he had never tried them. 

The food was hit and miss. I could eat baskets of the friend cheese curds like they're going out of style. The ramen was good but I was disappointed with the amount of meat. I'm drawing a blank a week and a half later about hubby's dish so maybe it wasn't that memorable? Hubby was a big fan of his bloody. I was impressed with the garnish. We ordered beignets for dessert and they were ok but not as fluffy as the real thing.

Wine list was ok, the beer my bf ordered was average. Started out with cheese curds, yum! As a MN girl that's had a few cheese curds, they were divine. Next, we devoured the Wedge salad. Amazing!! We decided to try the Graze burger and see what all the Rachael Ray hype was about. Now, I love expensive food so a $21 burger was intriguing to me... Well... It was good.. But we had just stopped at Culvers the night before and really enjoyed the butter burger... Is it wrong if we think they are comparable?

 Overall, great experience and would recommend for a fun night out. Skip the Graze burger and order one of the other delicious options, like the Bun which sounded amazing.",negative

Misses: Service staff can be hit-or-miss, but generally I've had positive experiences.

If you have a hangover, this bowl of deliciousness will kick it right in the chops.  The soup features home-made noodles from Wah Kee (also here in Madison), and--though the menu doesn't say this--I think the same delicious chili sauce that Wah Kee serves is brought to the table as a side.  There's so much good stuff in this bowl--the pork shoulder...the bok choy...the noodles...the poached egg.  There are plenty of other things on the menu that look fabulous (and that I've been tantalized by on other tables!), but me and my Ramen are exclusive--for now.  I also highly recommend a Supernova while you wait for your food.",positive

This place has me seriously considering adding strawberry season to my Google calendar so that I don't miss out next year.  The strawberry panzanella and strawberry shortcake were nothing short of amazing.  Other favorites from my most recent visit were the fried pickles, pork buns, and artisan cheese board.  The cheese curds are good, but not my favorite in Madison.

ch484,7/16/2013,revch1391,4,"We were here for lunch on a Thursday, right when they opened at 11 - first customers! (We were literally standing outside the door waiting for them to open shop :)

I went with the Korean Rice Bowl, which consisted of a glazed pork belly, kimchee (fermented Korean-style vegetables), mini cool cucumbers, and peanuts. It tasted decent. I think that I may have liked how it looked, more than how it tasted. The kimchee was a little too pickley/salty-tasting for my liking.

We also ordered their famous Pub Burger that's served on a house-made english muffin with bacon and cheddar cheese. That was definitely yummy.

The farmer john's sandwich of ham and provolone cheese with sliced apple, spinach, and basil pesto mayo on sliced baguette was pretty good, as was the soup that came alongside (can't remember what it was...it was the special of the day).

The overall atmosphere of the place was great. Very clean, updated, and cheery with the natural light from State Street shinning in. 

Their hot tea selection is plentiful and the Rishi brand that they sell is quality.  
Our waiter was very accommodating and considerate as well.

I hope to try out their offerings for brunch sometime soon as I hear that's pretty good!",positive
ch484,7/11/2013,revch1392,4,"A must-try foodie spot in Madison. All locally grown and sourced ingredients. Plus the chef is Korean? This explains the Korean dishes on the menu. 

Made the mistake of ordering jjamppong. Great idea for a dish. The scallop in it was the most tender I've had in my life. But the noodles were stuck together and not springy enough. And at $21 a plate, not totally worth it. 

The other things we ordered were five star quality. 

The Graze burger will slap you upside the head and make you realize this is what beef is supposed to taste like. White fish with daikon sprouts had aioli that was very fresh and creamy. The cheesecake was nice and light with really tasty-but-not-too-sweet bourbon cherries. 

Order a ""Spotted"", Wisconsin short-hand for a Spotted Cow Beer. This is an incredibly refreshing beer with a citrusy finish. On the lighter side of beers.

We ordered the deep fried cheese curds....yummy!  I had eggs benedict.  That was also very good.  In fact everyone in our group enjoyed their meal.  The 3-star rating was a result of the service.  It took a really long time for the waitress to first visit us upon being seated.  We placed a drink order only to wait a really long time again.  In fact, our drinks sat at the bar waiting to be served.  And when we finally placed our order we waited again.  I certainly don't mind a wait during a leisurely Saturday brunch.

Graze has won me over.  My first couple visits were less than memorable - I could see the potential in the menu, but the execution left something to be desired.  But over the past year, the consistency kitchen and the service has improved considerably and Graze has been coronated as The Emperor of Madison Brunch until further notice.  

After a recent trip to the Madison Farmer's Market, my wife and I decide the dodge the rain drops and grab some morning vittles (and libations).  There are a thirty minute wait for a table, so we decided to set up camp at the bar.  The bartenders promptly welcomed us and took our drink order.   I tried the Retox (Cachaça, Maple Syrup, lemon juice, cayenne) and my better half went with the Bloody Mary.  At first I was neutral on the Retox, but it eventually won my over as the Cachaça (a liquor made from fermented sugarcane juice) cleared the fog from a soggy slog around the square.  The Bloody Mary was a little heavy on the horseradish for my taste, but my dining companion was very impressed.

As for the culinary component, I elected to try something new and ordered the Chicken-Fred steak.  Instead of the usual cream-based sauce, this version had a excellent brown sauce with a hint of sage which complimented the steak, which was top notch, it had a nice crunch, but not greasy.  The rest of te dish was satisfying as well.  Some lightly dressed grape tomatoes, crispy hash browns and two eggs easy over that were perfectly executed.    Portion size was just right - I cleaned my plate and felt satiated, but not bloated.  We finished off our brunch date with an order of the beignets, and their pillowy goodness was the perfect finish to an excellent meal.

While the meal was a bit on the pricey side for brunch ($55 for two drinks, two entrees and a dessert), we both felt the value of the meal exceeded the price.

There have been some complaints about the service at Graze, but the bar staff was courteous and attentive during our meal.  Despite a full house in a relatively open space, the noise level was not too bad - it was easy to carry on a conversation.

I also appreciate how Graze uses locally sourced products from area farms to create its menu.  As long as they can continue to effective execute the vision of Chef Tory Miller, they will continue to be my go-to option for brunch.",positive
ch484,6/29/2013,revch1397,5,I was brought by someone who had been before.

I got Nutella-stuffed French toast that was super tasty without being too sweet or too filling. The house lemonade of the day was strawberry rhubarb and it was delicious. I saw that they have a nice selection of local cheeses, meats, and a couple of oysters. They also have wine on tap. I loved that the entire back of the menu was a list of the farms they work with.

We came here on a Sunday for brunch and had a great time. Absolute must is the croquet sandwich with a fried egg. So incredibly good with a beautiful buttered bread, melt in your mouth ham, and perfectly cooked egg sunny side up. Then try the loaded breakfast sandwich within bacon, 2 kinds of cheese, and fried egg. Wow so creamy and salty. Last try the pancakes with the cayenne butter

Herb Box is good, not knock your socks off good, but definitely satisfies and I love that it is local and semi-healthy (depending on what you order).

The food itself would have been 4 stars, but I knocked down half a star for the service and half a star for the price (too expensive for what you get).

I went with a party of 3 at 4:15, so it was an awkward time but I still expect to be served well, especially since it was't so busy. There seemed to be a lot of staff walking around, but for some reason there was only one waiter serving the entire inside of the restaurant (about 4 other parties). So, we flagged down another waitress and she took our order and sent it to the kitchen, which was nice.

We ordered the mac & cheese, the korean cauliflower, the market salad, beef short rib enchiladas, and the corn and goat cheese flat bread. My sister got a green flash beer, also.

The entrees were all great! I would have preferred if my chicken was cut up and tossed into my salad instead of having huge chunks on top, but it was moist and well seasoned. I appreciate the fact that they respected my wishes for EXTREMELY light dressing on my salad--overdressed salads are disgusting.The flat bread was great, and my sister said the enchiladas were also good.

I didn't particularly care for the mac & cheese. The portion was pretty small, the noodles were a little over cooked, and it wasn't the cheesy. The cauliflower, however, was spectacular! Need to learn how to make that at home.

I love the ambiance of the herb box! The decor is very modern-anthropologie-ish and the bathrooms are gorgeous. I noticed that theres a large room in the back for parties, also. Their outdoor seating looked nice too, but it was too cold the day I went.

We ordered our drinks and got them about 15-20 minutes later (not sure how long it takes to make a diet coke, but ok). When we asked the manager where our server was to take our order, he said that we were busy ""gossiping"" and that's why our order wasn't taken. This was the manager, Paul. Gossiping? Seriously? We are a group of 40 and older women, please calm down Paul. If you'd like us to gossip, I'm sure we can gossip about our bad service from this restaurant. We arrived at 10am, got drinks by 10:45am and by 11:30 we were still waiting for food. I had to go up to the bar twice to get a refill of soda and they screwed up one order of food and completely FORGOT another person's order. It's 12 people, I used to work in a restaurant. There were hardly any other patrons and they staff was too busy giving each other massages at the hostess stand to worry about tending to their customers. We spent $20 a meal plus drinks and a $70 cake, I expect far better service. I will tell everyone I know to skip this place and head to a restaurant that is more worried about tending to it's paying customers than trying to act as if they are too cool to care.",negative
ch513,12/21/2014,revch1406,4,A great meal made from fresh ingredients that will leave you full and satisfied. We enjoyed a seat outside while eating our sandwiches. The service was pretty good. Definitely a nice place to enjoy lunch while soaking up some sun.,positive
ch513,12/18/2014,revch1407,4,"Whenever we come to Phoenix, where to dine for dinner is a major decision. We are always relying on our friend Ryan to make the choice based on all the best places he has been to since our last trip out and then taking us to his favorite.  

Ryan tripped us up a bit this time by providing us a list and making us choose from some that he had been to and some he has been wanting to go to.  After about an hour and a half of careful menu reviewing by the three of us we picked The Herb Box.

Had I gone down the list in 5 minutes it would not have been my first choice and I think the other two of us felt the same.  We made our final decision based on the menu seemingly being able to quench our three very different moods for chicken, steak and something different. 

We arrived to an upscale looking place that really surprised us with elegant seating and our table was perfectly positioned near a welcoming fireplace.

The next best surprise, A honest server with a more exotic opinion on taste who was not afraid to add her own commentary, which I appreciate.

We started with shared plates and upon our servers suggestion we had the Korean fried cauliflower dish and the indian kale and corn pakora. I definitely left with a new found love of cauliflower and kale.  

Ryan was pretty much bent on the Korean barbeque ribs from the moment we picked the restaurant and was really happy he made that choice.  Michael was talked out of the buttermilk chicken by our server based on her saying it was good but not as expressive as the more flavorful choices on the menu that highlight the chef's choices to mix unique flavors.  He ended up choosing the ribeye along with me, my choice the minute I read thru the menu.  The queso blanco and cilantro lime gave the perfectly cooked ribeye an extra special boost.

We also shared the crisp fingerling potatoes sprinkled with course salt and the skillet corn and leek gratin.  I was excited about the corn and blown away by the potatoes.

I am not a connoisseur of mac n cheese by any means but will never refuse a taste from someone else's plate to make sure that my life doesn't end without having possibly tasted ""The one redeeming recipe"" that actually validates the existence of that dish.  I tasted Ryan's and thought to myself, ""wow, I could eat a dish of that,"" it was very good.

The Herb Box was really enjoyed by all of us and we were very happy we went there.  Definitely one of the weekend highlights!",positive
ch513,11/23/2014,revch1408,3,"Great food at both locations. Great ambiance Old Town late afternoon. Friends and I sat at Bar to watch Cardinals game and have wine and small plates. Kitchen closes at 4 on Sunday. Ok but bartender gave impression bar open longer. We ordered quickly before kitchen closed but when ordering another glass of wine, bartender said bar closed. No last call given. His service and attention poor. Otherwise we have loved all meals moth locations. Wait and bar staff iffy on a couple instances.",negative

Highly recommend the sweet potato tacos. It's also one of my go-to places for brunch. They're brunch is pretty popular. I recommend making reservations for brunch, but you can generally get in pretty quick for dinner. They also have a little market where you get delicious food to go.",positive
ch513,11/13/2014,revch1410,5,The Herb Box is my FAVORITE brunch spot. Their red velvet pancakes are to die for and their bacon is cooked to perfection. I've never had a bad experience here and they sometimes have crazy awesome mimosa flavors. You won't be disappointed!,positive

ch513,10/29/2014,revch1414,2,"Ugh.  If their food and outdoor seating was not so great, I would give them 1 star.  I do not understand if they are always constantly under new management or what.  I have been several times a year for years.  Glutton for punishment I suppose.  Last time I went with my mother, NOT during a busy time, early afternoon weekday, and do you know we sat for 22 minutes and NO ONE came to wait on us?  We were quite obviously sitting there, too.  We walked out.  And guess what?  Never going back.  

Their north Scottsdale spot, however, has always been superb.",negative
ch513,10/25/2014,revch1415,4,"Being unfamiliar with Scottsdale in general, I wasn't sure what to expect when staying in Old Town for work. It was with much delight that I realized my proximity to so many great restaurants. 

Take the Herb Box for example: large, open patio with plentiful seating for groups or just two, Christmas lights adorning the space, and the feeling that you are not in the middle of the desert. It being a Monday night, I was able to stay here sipping a notably refreshing cucumber and basil mojito for an extensive period of time whilst relishing the atmosphere. Service was somewhat attentive but they seemed to adapt to the type of evening you were desiring be it a large group with multiple requests or a low key night out. 

I tried the vegan nosh board. Yum. It includes shishito peppers, a quinoa spring roll, jalapeno edamame hummus with an edamame salad, and corn and kale pakoras. It was an innovative medley of cuisines and flavors and I truly enjoyed each part. The edamame salad was more mainstream but still spicy and with great texture from the pairing of creamy hummus and roasted corn. The spring roll filled with black quinoa and mango was an ideal vehicle for the accompanying dip, which had hints of nuttiness, perhaps peanut sauce based. The pakoras were crispy and light but all were secondary to the shishito peppers. I'm loving shishito pepper season and these were blistered to perfection with a sweet tamari glaze proving a balance of spicy and sweet. I highly recommend trying the nosh board as you have an array of tastes and spices for a decent price. Overall, a relaxing evening in Scottsdale.",positive
ch513,10/23/2014,revch1416,5,"Wonderful food and superb service.  Server Andrew T clearly enjoyed his work and took pride in the food he served, which made sense given the food's brilliance.  I, the vegan among 4 omnivores, greatly enjoyed the indian-spiced kale + corn and onion pakora and avocado love.  Any place with a vegan dessert gets an extra star, but Yelp only allows 5.  My party enjoyed their meals as well and meals were very affordable ($105 for a party of 5 with entrees and 2 desserts, without alcohol -- another $48 for a round of drinks).  Wish I lived in town to enjoy this restaurant more often but it will be a demand of mine for all future Phoenix trips (corporate office here so hopefully frequent!).",positive

Be aware that the $5 lunch plates are smallish portions, and that even the larger portions weren't big. They appear to be able to manage some allergies- I did fine with a pistachio/cashew allergy even though pistachios are on half the menu items. The waiter was happy to answer my questions about ingredients, including checking with the kitchen when he wasn't sure. They had a few GF items and a few vegan things as well. Overall this was a great place to hang out, if a bit pricey for what you get.",positive

What I had previously found lacking was the service.  After an absence of a few months, I am pleased to report, that the service at the Herb Box has improved dramatically with the addition of Vera.  She deftly and attentively handled our party of nine on Wednesday, Sept. 17.  We were there to celebrate a friend's birthday.  In addition to the usual tasks of serving and refilling water glasses, etc., Vera made knowledgeable recommendations about entrees and other menu items, along with wine suggestions.

I ordered the crab dip with plantains appetizer and had a chicken avocado salad as my entree. The crab dip was really salty and had hardly any crab in it. The salad was very bland and I wouldn't order it again. I will go back to try there squash enchiladas as I love those and Hardly ever find them when I go out to eat. Also I am gluten free and its hard to find menus that accommodate to my food allergies. I will give this place one more shot on the food, the service is great had a great server and food was delivered fast.

Our waitress, Vera, was extremely helpful, happy to help us with any questions that we had, quite knowledgeable about the menu and healthy food in general.  My bistro steak salad was great!  We didn't love the crab dip, however, it was taken off our bill without us saying a word.

So this time for my Mothers birthday we decided to try the Scottsdale one. First thing we asked our server ""are there any specials"" she said No, so we placed our orders & ordered a bottle of Prosecco as we all wanted a glass of champagne! She brought wine glasses, so we asked for champagne glasses, she said they were all out of them because of the Mimosa $5.00 brunch special? Um didn't we ask if they had any specials?? So We did try to talk to her about this & she said it wouldn't have made a difference as they were out of champagne? Well, we then see people served MIMOSAS. No apologies, were made to us.

Comfortable ambiance, good food and jet-fueled bartender. 

Had the short rib enchiladas. They were great, but the accompanying salad was even better. 

Their wine list was a little lite on the French side and they don't have any craft beers that I could find.  And, grab a table. The bar stools aren't designed for comfort - at least for 60 year old guys. 

I'll be back for sure.",positive

I ordered the sweet potato tacos and tried one of the short rib tacos and they were both amazing!  Everything tasted very fresh, the portions weren't overwhelmingly huge (I'm from Texas, so everything is HUGE!), and the presentation was beautiful.  I also had a sip of the mango lemonade which is made fresh daily and it was delicious!  I forgot our waitress' name but she had a European accent and she was very helpful!  She was very knowledgable about all the menu items and even spent some time talking to us about where she was from while learning a little bit about us.

I was debating between the Butternut Squash Enchiladas or the Sweet Potato Tacos. Our server recommended the Sweet Potato Tacos, so I ordered those. Sweet potatoes are my favorite vegetable, and I was glad I chose to order the tacos. They were very fresh and flavorful. Herb Box is pricey though! I do get it though, since the ingredients are fresh and whatnot.

Presentation is spectacular and the taste is divine. 

This is a great place to take a date or do a business lunch. It's very impressive.

ch513,7/11/2014,revch1447,3,"Almost completely unimpressed. The menu is pretty interesting but doesn't contain nearly as many vegan/vegetarian options as I thought it would. The cocktails are probably the best part about the menu. Every drink is a modern take on a classic. 

My girlfriend and I had a vegan platter that game with a couple small dishes of hummus, green beans, and something else that I can't recall. All were fairly good but it was twenty bucks for two people to feel mildly full. I usually don't complain about the size of the dishes (Americans are obviously confused about portion size compared to the rest of the planet, save for Mexico) but these were just...tiny. They were served in sauce cups or something.

The service was fine, but the guys who were working when I came through were the type you'd expect to find at a local bar like Hi-Fi or RnR. Tattooed, heavily-gelled hair and talking to the girls at the bar pretty much constantly. 

The decor is easily the coolest thing about the restaurant. It sits on the second floor by that bridge in old town Scottsdale, and at night it was a romantic place to have a fifty-dollar dinner that didn't fill me up.",negative

I came here with some friends, and I ordered the Kobe burger. My, it was so fantastic. It had a ciabatta bun, I think, and the burger was cooked to perfection. In addition, it was pleasantly paired with these fingerling potatoes. They were so well prepared, like mini baked potatoes. And the there were so many, I shared with the whole table. My friend ordered the cauliflower appetizer and it was so savory and delicious, and I just wish I knew how to prepare vegetables to become like these. My friend also ordered the braised beef which was so soft and buttery. My friends also raved about the corn and goat cheese pizza and the Gorgonzola pizza, which I intend to try next. The server was also the bartender and was very knowledgeable with wine. She recommended this cab wine and it was so delicious. 

We also sat outside, which was doable because of the surrounding misters, and we we're entertained by the lice music. Great time!",positive
ch513,6/3/2014,revch1451,4,"This is a very tasty place with fresh, local ingredients rather than a super healthy place.  It had far fewer vegetarian/pescetarian options than I expected, but still plenty of tasty choices.  Everything is delicious, and the trendy atmosphere, friendly waitstaff and beautiful patio round out an excellent experience.  

I love the Portobello Manchego burger - it's postively bursting with flavor and comes with a giant side of humus.  We've also had the sweet potato tacos (delicious! but a smallish portion size for the price and lack of meat/fish).  The mac and cheese is really lovely and gourmet, and fingerling potato salad is delicious (although, don't expect a ""salad"" - see photo).  Our vegan friend has thoroughly enjoyed the nosh board (note:the pitas at HB aren't vegan and they don't come with the nosh board, but if you're vegan, you can't order some on the side).  

I haven't tried the enchiladas and the salmon dish looks fancy (but has a fancy price to match), so there are only a few things that I can order.  As a result, I can't come here very often for dinner.  Looking forward to trying brunch sometime soon.

ch513,4/6/2014,revch1462,3,"I really wanted to like this place.  The concept is wonderful, everything is farm fresh, organic, and/or vegetarian.  My mouth watered at the words on the menu.  But, alas, my love never came to be.  We started with the mezza platter, which is basically a board with two giant scoops of hummus and a few olives for pizazz.  They are crazy stingy with the pita bread.  They seriously give you enough hummus to feed a country, and then one slice of pita cut into four small triangles.  You are left with a gallon of hummus and nothing to eat it with.  The kicker is that they charge you 3 bucks to get another small dish of pita bread so you can continue to eat your bland hummus.  On the bright side, we found a weird plastic nozzle in the middle of our hummus, so that got comped.  (If you consider finding a weird plastic thing in your food a bright side, that is)  The Gouda mac n' cheese was OK.  The butternut squash enchiladas were... you guessed it... OK.  Neither were bad, but they weren't great either.  It didn't make much impact.    My stars are bumped up to three because the atmosphere is to die for.  We sat on the patio, surrounded by beautiful trees and herbs like rosemary and lavender wafting in the air.  We had a view of the canal and it was a beautiful day.  The lovely decor gives this place an edge, but the food itself was really just.... meh.",negative

I got the lentil ricotta *meatballs* + lemony kale-basil pesto. It was delicious. Hubs got butternut squash corn enchiladas. They were out of this world.

ch513,3/25/2014,revch1468,2,I've been to the Herbox many times in the past. On this visit I was disappointed in the menu.  The menu was blah not the same. The usual wait staff not present & friendly. This use to be one of my favorite places in Scottsdale not sure now. Hope things go back the old way.,negative
ch513,3/20/2014,revch1469,2,"Okay, worst service I have experienced in a while. Bartender was rude... we were a group of 20-30 year olds and he treated us like we were a pain in the ass and made obnoxious comments suggesting we were poor and wouldn't be able to afford our choices.... like WTF, do your job and get over the fact we didn't order a soda and you actually have to do something. 

Once we were sat, (after being told by the hostess that we wouldn't be able to sit outside on the patio for over an hour.. which remained empty for the entire hour we were there) we sat down and still hadn't received our drinks from the bartender.... we probably sat there for 10 minutes waiting for any member of staff to acknowledge us and then had to go and grab ourselves glasses of the service table. 30 minutes later he takes our food order... food came in a relatively prompt fashion, but was mediocre. I love the effort, the menu is enticing and healthy but was no way wow, or mouth watering. Maybe try dinner. 

To sum this experience up.... disappointing. There are MUCH better places to eat in the Scottsdale area.",negative

Didn't realize they didn't open until late afternoon (it was 1pm). Any true sushi fanatic can tell you, when the heart wants sushi, it wants sushi.

But we made our ""Plan B"" option as The Herb Box. Okay, great! Still want sushi, but am excited to try this new place.

Well, as it turns out - I thought the little place on the corner was The Herb Box - it's not. That's the Herb Box Market! Not a lot of seating outside either. This was all let out in the open when I couldn't find my damn friends at the hostess station. 

Thought the girl who took my order was rather aloof, but did learn she was pretty new on the job so I cut her major slack. 

Ordered their Breakfast Burrito - it was good, but nothing to write home about. My GFs had buckwheat pancakes and pulled pork street tacos. 

I'll go back - but this time - to the real McCoy, as their patio furniture was a bit stained and weathered.",negative

My only issue was that we were told we'd get a text when our table was ready. We never got a text and went to check with the hostess. She said she texted us but took us off the list because we didn't respond. We were like 2 feet away....annoying. There were clearly tons of open tables and they didn't even call our name.",positive

I had a couple drinks appetizer, salad and a hair in my girlfriends sandwich.  This place claims to be American, that serves Mediterranean style dishes. Definitely not Mediterranean tried the Mezza sampler tasted like paste and chickpeas blended. Their organic salad was nothing special definitely way overpriced, lacking taste, for the price they better have used sea salt organic olive oil's and free range chicken that is non-GMO fed and I highly doubt they do that.

We first ordered our drinks and the Crisp Falafel Bites . . . they were to die for . . . crisp and warm . . . with herb roasted tomatoes and a variety of olives . . . to be honest . . . I could have eaten the whole order myself . . . and the passion fruit black iced tea . . . clear crisp and cold . . . the perfect pair.

For my entrée . . . the butternut squash corn enchiladas . . . it came with a roasted tomato verde salad . . . which perfectly offset the richness of the enchiladas.

We started with the Korean Cauliflower and I order the Thai baby back ribs for my meal. The Korean cauliflower tasted like a traditional Korean fried chicken, but cauliflower. The ribs were great, but I have to admit that the highlight of the meal was the Mac and Cheese. Best Mac and cheese I've eaten. Another plus is the big food portion. 

Overall, great restaurant and I highly recommend this restaurant.",positive

We had an attentive waiter, Howie, who dealt with my food allergies.  We started out with a wonderful cocktail with meyer lemons.  We had the beet salad and the roast grapes bruschetta for small plates.  A great start followed by the sublime roasted chicken with tomato/gorgonzola butter, green bean/fingerling potato salad and roasted brussels sprouts.  We finished with beetroot chocolate cake. Yumm!

ch513,1/19/2014,revch1485,5,"I absolutely loved this place and my entire experience. 
My ZenJen cocktail was one of the best I've had recently- perfect combination of sweetness and tang. 
For shared plates we had the Avocado Love and the Cilantro-lime crab dip.  The Avocado Love comes with a mulitgrain toast under a sea of arugula and avocado. Initially the plantain chips that came with the crab dip were a bit soft, but the waiter promptly and graciously replaced with with crispier ones. The cilantro-lime crab dip itself was impressive. It is entirely pureed with an exquisite combination of flavors that were well-complimented by the plantain chips. The bf had to keep telling me ""you've already said that"" every time I gushed about how much I loved both dishes.
The portions of the small plates were actually so large that we almost wanted to cancel our main entree of Baby back ribs. The ribs were so tasty though that I somehow made room for them. They come with a bowl of gouda mac and cheese, with a crumbly top just the way I like it. I wish I had room for dessert since the dessert menu seemed very interesting. 
Overall, swanky ambience, with a good crowd of people without being overly loud. I loved everything we had and wanted to explore even more on the menu. Compliments to the chef for a very fresh, creative, delicious menu. This is one of the best dining experiences I've had in a while. Excellent, friendly service.
Better to make a reservation if coming on a Friday/Saturday night.",positive
ch513,1/4/2014,revch1486,2,"I am really into good tasting food and this place lacked just that, taste. Everything was just bland. I should have known as soon as the waitress told me not to order the skirt steak. The service was lacking as well.",negative

I ordered the cilantro-crab dip with plantain chips to start. I should've been less greedy as the menu clearly stated apps to SHARE. Nonetheless, it was delicious with lumps of crab swirled in throughout. Definitely recommend!

My main was the goat cheese? And capicola (sp) flatbread topped with crispy kale. My kale was burnt beyond recognition but I just threw it to the side a munched away. Very crunchy flatbread, which is a must, and great ingredients. WAs really tasty!

The waitress was not familiar with menu or ingredients. When we asked about the boston cream that was supposedly in the dossants (dessert), she admitted there wasn't any even though the menu listed it. That would have been nice to know before ordering. The other dessert Crack Pie, was cold and seemed to be thawing out. Not what I was expecting, I inquired about it and the server took it back to the kitchen where I'm certain it was warmed in the microwave. 
Oh yeah, the plastic green plant on the tabletops were not overly impressive either.",negative
ch513,11/22/2013,revch1496,3,"Definitely a very nice place with good food options, but I think a little too expensive. It is cute and is in Old Town, so that's probably why the prices go up, but still. I came in on a Friday for an early lunch (seated by 11:30 am) and our service took quite some time. One of the salad orders was also messed up, and the waitress tried to cover it up and explain it away instead of just doing something about it, but it was eventually comped. I had the portabella burger with a side salad (an expensive side salad I might add, practically the cost of ordering the house salad but 1/3 of the size). It was fine, not mind blowing, but not terrible either. The mushroom was a little on the chewy side, and I wish they had put more of the flavorful aioli on it because the bun was very thick (and so much less flavorful).",negative
ch513,11/18/2013,revch1497,4,"Went for a very nice midweek lunch.  The location can't be beat...  right on the waterfront in Old Town Scottsdale.  You can sit outside on the patio and enjoy a water view.  

We started with a Bloody Mary (pretty good) and a specialty cocktail (can't remember which one and their online menu isn't current).  For lunch we got the Korean fried cauliflower, the mac n cheese and the pear and Gorgonzola flat-bread.   Everything was good - especially the smoked Gouda mac n cheese, which is delicious...  with a nice crisped top and tons of cheesy goodness.  My pear and Gorgonzola flat-bread was also a highlight, with a nice crisp crust.  

The menu is interesting and just borders on the verge of being a little too vegan/healthy for me.  Non health nuts will find some things to eat, but your choices are a little limited.  

Service was friendly and efficient.  Bathrooms are over designed (you'll get soaked attempting to use their modern concept sink - which is pretty but completely nonfunctional) and too small and dark.  

I would recommend if you're visiting Old Town Scottsdale.",positive
ch513,11/10/2013,revch1498,2,"For Sunday brunch:

Issues mostly related to poor service and it was not crowded yet. One of our orders was incorrect and the waitress never checked to see if things were ok. The temp and texture of our food led us to believe it had been sitting out a while. I was never asked if I wanted more coffee and it was never offered. Even when waitress came to give us the bill she never inquired about the meal and at that point we just wanted to get on with our day. All in all pretty lousy experience that was not worth the $$.

Lots of options for vegetarians and gluten-free dieters.  I had the butternut squash and corn enchiladas which came with a side salad and were quite tasty.  My husband had the short rib tacos which were also nice.  

Our server was a bit odd, but overall did a nice job.  When ordering a beer we asked for suggestions and he said, ""Yeah, it's a good beer.  Convinced me to switch from bud light""  While not a roaring endorsement for a boutique beer, it was still a good suggestion.

ch513,10/9/2013,revch1505,4,"A couple weeks back I drove down to AZ to visit my pledge sister from my college sorority days.  She has been on a quest to find some of the best restaurants in AZ before she moves back home at the end of the school year. The Herb Box popped onto her list after yelping and hearing other talk about it.  She didn't have to twist my arm to go here for Sunday Brunch, especially when she mentioned Red Velvet Pancakes (funny thing is I didn't even order them once I saw their yummy menu)

My other friend and I decided to share two dishes, because it isn't every day that we find ourselves in Arizona and there were just too many things to choose just one.  We decided one sweet and one savory to be well balanced!


For the sweet:
Cinnamon buckwheat pancakes (9) served with wild blueberries and strawberries, smoked applewood bacon, and whipped honey butter.  I am definitely a fan!  As intrigued as I was by the Red Velvet Pancakes, I'm happy that my friend went with these pancakes instead.  They were the perfect balance of sweet and not too sweet.  Also the buckwheat made me feel like I was being a little healthier without it tasting healthier.  Now I'm not a bacon fan, (*gasp* yes not everyone loves bacon) but everyone else who does like bacon loved theirs.

For the savory:
I picked the smoked salmon hash (14) that came with crisp fingerlings, pancetta bacon, scallions, fried capers, aioli, and soft egg.  I know, that I just said I didn't like bacon but I picked a dish with pancetta bacon...but I love smoked salmon so I couldn't resist.  I could definitely taste the bacon but I thought it went well with everything else so I didn't mind.  I really enjoyed this dish and if you likely hearty salty goodness in the morning or for brunch would recommend trying this out

Not only was the food great their decor was also really fun and stylish.  There was several vintage pieces with a twist that gave it a very modern feel.  Also their bathrooms had some of the most interesting sinks that I'm having a hard time describing ...I wish I took a picture.

Overall, a great find by my friend.  If I lived in Scottsdale, I would go back without a doubt.",positive

The first time we got the pita chips and hemp hummus, as well as the smoked Gouda macaroni and cheese. DELISH! The second time we got the sweet potato chips and they were perfectly sweet, salty, and crunchy. Great food, and nice staff. Great place for a quick snack or lunch!",positive
ch513,9/23/2013,revch1509,2,"Food was great in theory, but don't expect any dietary restrictions you have to be competently accommodated. Example: can't eat most grains, so ask for the shrimp on the salad to be grilled (rather than battered and fried), and the avocado not to be on toast. Shrimp grilled, but avocado appears mashed and spread on toast AND the server failed to mention that the fennel on the salad is also battered and fried. This silliness happened after I had already asked about tweaking two other items to be to accommodate dietary restrictions, and was told that everything is ""made fresh"" except for, apparently, those other two items.

This appears to be part-and-parcel of the service problems referred to by other reviewers; our service was also extraordinarily SLOW. One member of our party waited 10 minutes for his food after the rest had been delivered. 

To top it off, I'm not really sure what the restaurant is doing having the gardener moving around whatever buckets and cloths and chemicals/pesticides he's using in the immediate vicinity of actively eating tables. It's not like the place is open for breakfast during the week, couldn't the owners have scheduled plant maintenance for a morning?",negative
ch513,9/22/2013,revch1510,2,"Went here with a friend the other night and our food was excellent!  However, the service was the worst I've had in a long time.  The waiter took 20 minutes to bring us water and take our order.  The manager came over to fill both of our water AND wine glasses that had run dry because the service sucked so bad.  When we mentioned how we had been abandoned, she offered to take our order which turned out to be the wrong food being brought out.

ch513,9/13/2013,revch1512,4,"My husband and I have been here a few times now. We've enjoyed their bread pudding and s'mores crème brulee on a previous trip. The bread pudding was decadent with ice cream smothering it. The s'mores crème brulee came with chocolate crème brulee, house-made graham crackers, and dipped marshmallows. It was good but excessive. Definitely a dessert to share.

My recent trip was to try the cronuts (or doissants or whatever) that everyone has been raving about. When I arrived, the bakery case only had one butterscotch cronut left. I asked the employee behind the counter about some of the other pastries (they had a delicious looking blueberry tart) and decided I might as well get the cronut. She told me it was the last one of the day - once they run out they are gone for the day. I took it to go and enjoyed it later that night. (It tasted like a regular donut with cream filling. I don't get what the craze is!)

Overall, the Herb Box is a great place for lunch and desserts. (Either location.) This particular location has become more of a dessert spot for me. I love that they have a large patio for both the restaurant and take-away spot.",positive
ch513,9/7/2013,revch1513,1,It was okay. The food came late and the drinks were mixed up. It's okay if you want to spend $15 on a salad with mostly greens and not much else. Overly priced and the rib eye us full of fat!,negative

The food was even mostly impressive (two out of our four meals were stellar; one was awful; the other was passable).  There are so few inventive, original restaurants with vegetarian/vegan options, so please fix your problems and thrive!

The service was absolutely lousy.  I think we got the same male waiter listed by another reviewer.  He would disappear for 15 minute blocks of time.  It took him multiple promptings to refill a wine glass (this is a huge missed revenue opportunity for both the server and restaurant).  I'm sure it was not all his fault.  The food took forever to come out and there where few people in the restaurant.  I wonder if the kitchen was struggling.  It took 20 minutes for a cheese plate!  

The owner came out at one point but didn't seem to notice or care that one of us had not touched his ""medium"" burger that was raw.  She didn't ask if everything was okay or question the uneaten food.  Good restaurants notice these things and ask why.  Otherwise you can guarantee you've got a table that will not return.

What really sucked is we waited 45 minutes to get our meals and to me this is unacceptable at this place. It's not like we ordered a steak, deep dish pizza or a soufflé. Any way the food was great and the chef bought us dessert. Happy. 
Clean place with good ambience.",positive

The location is nice as well as it is situated right next to the canal. You can people watch if you decide to sit outside and not worry about the heat because they have the misters.

ch513,7/31/2013,revch1525,3,"My girl friends and I visited Herb Box for Saturday Breakfast. Inside the decor is contemporary, bold yet comfortable. We made a reservation for 9:30am and arrived to an empty restaurant. Not that surprising since Scottsdale rarely rises for meals until closer to 11am. Considering we were one of three patrons I expected some over the top service. Not so much. The servers for the other two tables looked prompt, concerned and courteous. Our server seemed pretty stuck up and dismal. Frankly at 9:30am, I'll take my coffee without a side of pretentiousness thank you. 

Regardless of our lack luster server or whoever she was, we ordered our breakfast.

I ordered the simple good morning, served with eggs, bacon, white cheddar, avocado, tomato and toast.  It was ""meh"". Not bad, not great. A good option if you are in the mood for a lighter meal without going sideways and too adventurous. 

Note to Box: at least ask your table if they want salt and pepper. Never heard of a restaurant without the basic condiments. 

I also ordered a cappuccino (pretty good by the way) and mimosa (for $8, go elsewhere in S-dale for the competitors who understand the value of a cheap mimosa even if its not Sunday brunch.) 

Overall Herb Box was OK, no real complaints, no real dazzle.",negative
ch513,7/18/2013,revch1526,5,"We were looking for some modern, imaginative Southwestern cuisine for lunch, and we found exactly that at The Herb Box.

Nearly all the menu items are creative, blending ingredients you're not likely to find elsewhere.   Five stars for imagination, for the kitchen's execution of these ideas, and for the well-organized and very attentive service (and this, 15 minutes before closing time.)

The plantain chip and dip appetizer was a nice starter, with the chips themselves as interesting as the dip.  

The two entree salads that came to our table were fulfilling and full of fresh leafy, crunchy, and meaty elements in good proportion (i.e enough greens, a generous portion of protein, and just the right amount of seeds and dried fruit).  The dark pepper-based house made dressing on the shrimp salad was notable for being slightly sweet but with a strong kick.  

The grilled cheese comes with sweet potato chips, the latter being about the only thing on the table that could be considered just OK.  

Portions are generous. For dessert, the strawberry shortcake dessert was enough for 3 or 4 people.  The shortbread was a had a biscuit-like texture but was very moist, a rare and welcome combination.  I only wish I could go back to see what ""lemon meringue unpie"" could be.    

Good for kids? I would have guessed  ""no"" except that I've never seen my five-year-old put away a whole grilled-cheese sandwich, especially one on such interesting, ""adult-oriented"" dark and grainy bread.  

The ice teas were remarkably good, to the point that I felt sorry for what my Coke-drinking table mates were missing.",positive
ch513,7/18/2013,revch1527,5,"Got here a little late, they were just about to close...but...the manager decided we could eat. And am I glad he did.

ch513,7/7/2013,revch1530,5,"The Herb Box is quite possibly my favorite lunch spot in Old Town.  It's definitely the first place to pop in my mind when someone asks where they/we should go to lunch.

The atmosphere is my second favorite part, next to the brown sugar pork ciabatta, which I'll get to in a minute.  The Herb Box offers a rustic/nautical feel, with white and blue wood throughout along with circular mirrors, resembling a sea-side eatery back home.  The inside is a funky combination of homey and trendy, providing a comfort that the food is going to be just as good.  It's always a toss-up to sit inside or out on the patio, no matter the time of year.  The dining room is hard to beat, but the outdoor patio is equally as great with the perfect amount of shade + misters for hot summer days.  Wherever you chose to sit, somehow find your way to the ladie's/men's room as the restrooms are probably my third favorite part of HB - never thought the bathrooms would make it into my reviews, but HB puts a touch of class on every aspect of their café.

Now on to the food: I have tasted a solid third of HB's menu.  Everything is good, I haven't had one thing that I was disappointed in.  As with many of my favorite restaurants, there is a reason it's a favorite because one item stands out above the rest.  The pork ciabatta does it for me.  I should start by describing how large the portion is - be prepared to take part of your lunch home unless you're super hungry.  The pulled pork is served with an interesting complement of jicama and red pepper slaw.  The flavors are so, so good.  Of course served on ciabatta, which who doesn't love ciabatta?  All of their sandwiches come with a side of their homemade sweet potato chips, which are definitely worth the carbs.  If you're feel frisky, order a side of their red pepper aioli to give your sweet potato chips a little zing.  My order isn't complete with one of their many flavors of iced teas.  I have recently become obsessed with their mango and green tea combo.

If you're making an event out of lunch or plan to stay longer, go for the cheeseboard of the moment as a starter.  My fiance and I are cheese-aholics, and their cheeseboard is delectable, accompanied with fruit, jam, honey and nuts - yum.

If you're wondering where to go on your tour of Old Town either as a tourist or a local, I hope you make a smart decision and go to the Herb Box, you will be so happy you did.",positive
ch513,7/7/2013,revch1531,4,"I absolutely loved finally getting to The Herb Box, after seeing it so many times of going to ArtBridge Thursdays in the Fall.  Four of us went, for an anniversary dinner.  Looking forward to it for days, and it was well worth going.  As said by others, the ambiance is beautiful... a perfect compliment for Scottsdale weather and surroundings.  

We chose early dinner service on a Saturday, happily avoiding rushes or crowds.  The background music was just right too.   In 115 degrees, we only ever consider Inside seating!  So, we were very comfortable, especially with the chairs being wide and nicely cushioned.  

Our service was good... very very good when he was at our table.  A few times, he was not around, so we had to ask another server for an extra aioli for the fingerlings, for extra napkins and waited a bit for refills on the raspberry hibiscus iced tea (a really nice tea).   We do not recall the server asking if we wanted refills on the two alcohol beverages.   The water service was on top of things though.  

The server was very helpful with letting us know all about the menu... very very helpful with it being our first time.  Every time he was at our table, he was so nice and helpful.

At our table, we had:
Fingerling Potatoes with aioli---  Perfectly cooked... But, it was the first sign that I, personally, needed to ask the server to bring salt to the table.  (I always taste my food before adding salt... always hoping I don't need to.)  

Cilantro-jalapeno edamame hummus, with grilled naan---  Very tasty!

Butternut Squash Corn Enchiladas--- Good, would like to try something else next time, the server really really pushed it.

Portobello manchego 'burger'--- Delicious

Coffee molasses glazed grilled pork chop--- Good but for about $24, it should have been more than 1 pork chop, coleslaw and two thin slices of sweet potato.

Thai BBQ Baby Back Ribs--- Delicious especially the BBQ sauce on the ribs... it went well with the green apple slaw slices... the Smoked Gouda Mac & Cheese was very very light on the cheese and thank goodness for the panko, that made it worth eating... otherwise, I kinda kept looking for some aspect of it looking cheesy...  it did have a thin cheese sauce,(and it makes sense that this restaurant  does work hard at healthier options... so no blame to them.) I added salt, so that made it better, too.

We all shared a dessert of Tres Leches cake with strawberries.  Very nice and they did make it seem like a lighter option.  A tasty ending.   

All in all, very happy with going to The Herb Box... It seems picky to point out the details, but that's where the difference is between Great and WOW I CAN'T WAIT to go back.  This was a very very nice experience, wondering what it would be like to go again.   Oh, yes, it was SUPER GREAT to have such GREAT choices for our vegetarian friends.   That's a huge reason why we picked going there.",positive
ch513,7/4/2013,revch1532,4,"Very nice atmosphere, unique menu, great service and delicious food. 
I went here for dinner with a friend and we ended up splitting several items on the menu to try more things. We ordered the happy hour portion mac-n-cheese which was very, very good. Their version is made with smoke gouda and results in a lighter result than the traditional version of mac-n-cheese. We also ordered the smoked trout beignets. These are like a delicious hush puppy filled with smoke trout served with a red pepper aioli sauce. Then it was onto dessert. This was one of the first times I've ever been presented with so many tasty options, it was hard to choose. So we ended up getting three different things-yes three. We really wanted to order a fourth, but were totally stuffed by this time. We ordered the tres leche cake with sweet cream and strawberry sauce. It was more of a strawberry shortcake than anything, but it was absolutely delicious. Next was the banana chocolate créme bruleé. The caramelized bananas were the hit of this dish. Served with what I can only describe as a nutella won ton. Again, very good, but more of a chocolate-banana moose with caramelized bananas on top. Finally at the recommendation of the server, we ordered the peach bread pudding. I have to preface this by saying that I'm not a huge fan of bread pudding. After eating this dessert, I would HIGHLY recommend it. It was so full of delicious flavors, I can't even describe it in words.",positive
ch513,7/1/2013,revch1533,5,"Such a pleasant experience I must say. I had brunch at this charming eatery while visiting Scottsdale over the weekend. It is located on the banks of the Arizona Canal offering fantastic menu with amazing selection for meat lovers as well as Veggie lovers.  I loved the interior decoration which remind me of a relaxing beach cottage. 

Our server was fantastic and very passionate and knowledgeable with the menu. 

The food was yummy and flavorful we ordered the following options: 

Urban market steak salad which was so good. Steak was done medium just as requested served with watercress, avocado, sweet red pepper, sugared pecans, bacon, sweet dried corn and house blue cheese vinaigrette. 

MY favorite: Serrano Garlic shrimp salad which was mouth watering and perfect amount of spice (not over powering) with Serrano chili, you can request the sauce to be on the side if you are afraid of spice. Shrimp were served over avocado toasts and wild arugula, crisp fennel, pancetta and lemon honey vinaigrette. 

We also had the breakfast steak and eggs, Stead was done to perfection and was served with potatoes.

The service received was exceptional, not only did the waitress knowledgable about the menu items she was able to make a recommendation so that I could try both of the items that I was debating.  Our water glasses were never empty. There was just the right amount of checking to ensure our meal was going well without being too intrusive.

The food was more than what was expected.  Having heard great reviews from friends, I was not disappointed.  I tried the pork green chili dish. And I have to say that it actually has become my new favorite, which given its comparison is a huge compliment. I also got to sample the red velvet pancakes with both regular syrup and their special blend.  Wile being delicious by themselves they were phenomenal with the special blend syrup. Adding mango to the traditional orange juice mimosa was very tasty and was a fabulous compliment to the brunch.",positive

I tried the Salmon Hash and the Red Velvet Pancakes. Both where very good.  I do prefer my salmon a little less well done than they are in the hash but I understand it would be difficult considering the way it must have been prepared.  The Red Velvet pancakes where a little rich for my taste but still very good.

The menu offers a wide range of foodie friendly comfort food that will satisfy the vegetarian and omnivore alike.  There was also a good list of mixed drinks.  I would recommend the sangria over the mojito.  I had the ribs and macaroni and cheese with bread crumbs.  The bread crumbs make it fancy.  There is some great outdoor seating when the weather is accommodating.  The restaurant is on the Scottsdale waterfront.  I don't quite get the fake herbs as a center piece of each table, but the restaurant does seem to be surrounded by an herb garden.  There's a bakery down stairs that makes some of the menu items.  I'm sure we'll be back, and may even take the parents next time they are in town, if you get my drift.",positive

Service is great, and we were visited by the manager Lance. Andy our server kept us all laughing and making us want to stay for rounds of more drinks. The kid probably makes them $1000's a year alone just by keeping people in their seats listening to his comedic references and ordering more cocktails. Lance made sure everything was perfect and looks like he can handle just about any situation.

ch513,6/14/2013,revch1539,4,"I ate brunch there last Sunday. I had the red velvet pancakes.  Yumm!!!  The food, the waiter, the atmosphere and even the bathroom decor was 100% what a sunny, mimosa-filled brunch day in Scottsdale should be.  

It was truly difficult to choose only one meal because the menu is fabulous.  They have a mimosa deal that if you get an entre and the mimosa deal, it's about $20 or so and it's as many mimosas you can drink.  They had four flavors: original (oj), grapefruit juice, cranberry and mango.  Their mimosas are mostly champagne, which made me extra happy!

The waiter was very attentive and thoughtful despite the place being very busy.  And he, like many who work there, was easy on the eyes.

The bathroom looks like something out of Alice in Wonderland or Regina's office on Once Upon a Time, i.e., black, white and mirrors.  Very nice/ elegant, although I was confused when I thought the wall was moving (just a mirrored door) to the stall.

There was some good people watching going on that day.  I apparently didn't get the memo that it was pink day.  Lots of people wearing pink, even men in golf-style pink shirts.  A lot of the women looked over processed, but it's Scottsdale, so what do you expect?  It's fun to watch the scene.

I would highly recommend this place to others.  The only down side is that I called and made a reservation ahead of time and they had no record of it, despite a 5 minute conversation to set up the reservation.  They still accommodated my part, however.",positive
ch513,6/8/2013,revch1540,4,"Been here several times, so quite puzzled how I never got around to writing a review. Maybe I just assumed everyone knew what a wonderful little place this was and reviews weren't needed.

Well, just in case, this is a wonderful little place. I never have the same thing twice because everything is so tasty. This most recent trip I had their sweet potato tacos, which were full of flavor and texture. They have a lot of vegetarian, vegan, gluten-free, and other nutty (or nut-free) dietary choices, but that doesn't phase me. I'm a devoted carnivore, but will happily eat a vegetarian dish if it is well done. And The Herb Box does them well.

My husband and I had a nice meal here.  I had the shrimp salad and a glass of white wine.  He had a sandwich but honestly do not remember which one it was.  The best part of the afternoon was it was a warm day there and I do believe it was snowing in Colorado.

My favorite lunch item is the Turkey Ciabatta (Gouda Cheese, Smoked Bacon, Sweet Tomato, Roasted Red Pepper Aioli), $11.  It has a perfect blend of ingredients that has a combination of smoked & sweet flavors with the Turkey.  This is great for lunch because it's satisfying, but does not weigh you down during the afternoon.

ch513,5/5/2013,revch1546,3,"We stumbled upon The Herb Box while walking around in old town, the patio space looked amazing and the menu was good so we stopped in. It was about 7:30 on a Saturday but they sat us right away. Off the bat it seemed like we were in for a great night, but once seated the night took a turn.
 First, we waited for at least 15 minutes for our waiter to even come over and take our drink order. It was clear he was overwhelmed because he asked to take our drink and food order at the same time. Not my favorite way to start what is suppose to be a romantic dinner. It took another 10 or 15 minutes to get the drinks we ordered and then we didn't see our sever again until half an hour after that when we got our food. It seemed like an exceptionally long wait to not be offered another drink.
The my food was delicious, I had the enchiladas the large salad that came on the side was a great compliment. My husband had the ribeye, he ordered it medium rare and it came out pretty much bloody, it took the waiter about 10 minutes to come back and check in us, at that point my husband sent the steak back in to the grill. The server was really kind about this but then brought the steak back without a fork to eat it with, having learned by this point, I asked for a fork before he left our table and it still took 5 minutes to get it. 
Toward the end of the night our server chatted us up about beer and pot and chochella. We were down to talk, but him steering the convo toward pot because we are from CO was slightly unprofessional. 
Overall it seems like this place could be great if they polished the customer service and the attention to detail. I get that you are busy but as a customer I never want to feel your stress.",negative

We sat outside on the patio and it couldn't have been more gorgeous. Nice comfy seats with umbrellas, picturesque, with a bubbling fountain nearby and plenty of greenery.

The food was sublime for the most part. The waiter - super friendly and helpful - recommended the Avocado Love and we ordered two of those. I almost went back the next day just to get it. It was like an amazing salad bruschetta. My BF, a carnivore who makes it a point of not eating anything green, loved it. We also got the crab and cilantro dip. I loved the combination of cheesy crab and citrus and cilantro, though I would have liked the plaintain chips to be a big larger and more substantial (it was hard to pick up the dip with the flimsy scraps of chips). We also got the brisket sliders - looked awesome, the taste was solid but nothing to write home about - and the tacos (I didn't try those).

I ordered the breakfast burrito with ""laura g's award winning salsa"" and a refreshing fruit salad.  It was good, but I've had better salsas.  Also ordered at our table were the breakfast brisket sandwich (impossibly messy but weighed in favorably with those who tried it), red velvet pancakes (good, but got soggy quickly), granola (A+) and coffees (also good).

I went to try H.B. for the first time on Monday (3/25). When I got there, they took my name and the host said 10 minutes. I came back 15 minutes later, and the same host said another 10 minutes. I came back 10 minutes later and a hostess said I still had 2 names ahead of mine and she apologizes ""we are waiting for the servers to catch up""

I looked inside and there were plenty of seats. I said ""why not bring people off the curb and offer them drinks at least."" To which she replied ""sorry, just what my manager said""

So I called Citizen Public House and they prepared a table for me on the spot. (IT WAS MONDAY) I won't be trying again.

I don't give out many ""excellent"" ratings but The Herb Box deserves one. The serrano-avocado shrimp salad was particularly good. Nice beer and wine list and creative cocktails as well. Can't wait to come back to the Valley from Wisconsin and try this place again.",positive

Thank you Yelpers, for this place did not disappoint! We shared the cilantro crab dip - creamy, crabby goodness that had just enough acidity to get our palates going. The plantain chips were an excellent touch - the perfect vehicle for all of that crabby yumminess. I had the burger (medium) on ciabatta. It was cooked perfectly, seasoned perfectly, and had the most amazing apple coleslaw to add crunch, bite, and contrast. These came with sweet potato chips which were absolutely addicting! We also shared a side of the gouda mac and cheese - very cheesy, but surprisingly not heavy at all!

Our server was fantastic! Our waters never emptied, our soda/tea stayed full, and he always checked in at appropriate times. This was the best possible way to end our short trip :)",positive

The garden patio along the canal was  picturesque and relaxing. 
I had the BBQ chicken flat bread, which was phenomenal, homemade incredible sweet potato chips, and a drink the name of which escapes me, but was basically a tequila Mojito made perfectly with fresh ingredients.  I will certainly be a repeat customer on my next trip.",positive
ch513,2/21/2013,revch1566,5,One of my favorite restaurants in Arizona. I brought my family here from out of town and they wanted to come back the next day. The salads and wraps are awesome. My mom loved the sweet potato tacos.,positive

ch513,2/10/2013,revch1568,1,"My fiancé and I attended a dinner party here. Immediately, I noticed it was crowded and had live music. I took that to be a good sign. 

Upon glancing at the menu, I noticed some very unique dishes. Butternut squash enchiladas? Who knew? I also noticed prices averaging around $20 per plate. That was slightly off-putting, but I was excited to try something new. I expected hearty portions and fine food. 

My fiancé ordered the Kobe burger, topped with applewood bacon, Brie cheese, and apple-jicama slaw. He liked the burger, though he ordered it well done and it came out medium to medium-well. However, it was about half the size of a burger you would expect to see at twice the price. 

I ordered the short rib chili with cornbread dumplings. I was not pleased. It was incredibly greasy and the meat had hunks of fat still attached. The cornbread dumplings were good, but there were only three of them, each about half the size of a ping-pong ball. Altogether, our meal cost about $50. It's worth mentioning that we did not order any alcohol, and we were still hungry after leaving. 

In short, if you are looking for unique flavors in a downtown atmosphere, you would probably be quite impressed. If you are looking for decent food at reasonable prices, I would suggest eating elsewhere.",negative
ch513,2/9/2013,revch1569,4,"The daily special was an excellent option for a vegetarian like me, and an ok value for the downtown Scottsdale area. I got a (smallish) grilled cheese/caramelized onion/apple sandwich, cup of potato leek soup, and side salad for $15, but more to the point, it was all great. We sat on the very nice patio and they didn't give us any attitude for being all scruffy and probably a bit smelly post-Camelback Mt. hike. Don't miss the absurdly fancy bathroom. (Warning about the patio - the table next to us was being dive-bombed by aggro birds. Apparently it has something to do with ordering Diet Coke and saccharin?) My husband said his grilled chicken sandwich was great too, and his crispy potatoes were AWESOME. VERY close to five stars overall. I guess I'm holding back on that 5th star because service was a bit slow (a lot of ""I'll be right back with that""... and 10 minutes go by), but we were at the end of the lunch rush and luckily not in a hurry. Very pleasant meal and a highlight of our trip to AZ.",positive
ch513,2/4/2013,revch1570,4,"I've been to the North Scottsdale location and this one is just as nice. Friday night we sat out on the patio overlooking The Scottsdale Canal (sorry, can't quite get into calling it The ""Waterfront""). 

White Chicken Chili was fabulous, not too spicy and I ordered a side of toasted ciabatta bread for dipping/sopping up the wet parts. Yum.

One of their signature dishes was The Roasted Chicken--DEElish; so many grilled flavors on one plate; worth the 20 minute prep time!

Not quite a fan of the ciabatta bread used as a hamburger bun for the Kobe Burger (and the burger itself was only ""okay"") and the side for said meal was a bit of a turn-off for my husband and I agree that he should have been offered a different side with it...

Otherwise, great service, great atmosphere.

Yes, we'll be back (again).",positive
ch513,1/30/2013,revch1571,5,"I'd love this place for its relaxing garden ambiance alone. Go to the full dining restaurant and eat indoors or pick up a few dishes from the deli area downstairs.  The downstair area does not have the full menu, but is designed to get a quick take out bite.  There is a nice little patio (complete with comfy chairs and misters), which is perfect for lunch when weather is good.  No matter where you dine--the food is healthy and tasty, plus moderately priced. Check out their Jasmine Green Tea for something refreshing--it is perfect sipping for a hot summer day. The dessert menu is extra tempting, but I have viciously beat back my sugar cravings and declined to give them a try.  If I ever order a dessert, I will revise this review and add my thoughts.  

Parking is meh. It's old town Scottsdale, so good luck there. But if you find a spot, this place is near the canal and there is nice walking to be had after eating.",positive

The food is consistently very good and the employees are friendly. It is a bit on the pricey side for sandwiches and a la carte items, but I have not been let down there yet!",positive
ch513,1/29/2013,revch1573,4,The food here is good and I think is priced very well. The best part of eating here is the patio. There is usually a little arts walk right on the bridge during the summer and its very fun to sit and eat outside.,positive

ch513,1/12/2013,revch1576,3,"This is a cool restaurant that reminds me of an Amish restaurant I went to years ago.  Kind of country design, large wooden furniture.  Its nice, but slightly crowded (I don't like it when you hit the chair of the person behind you when you pull out the chair a bit to get out.  The way the furniture is designed you have to pull it out quite a ways to free a limb, even if you're petite.)  

The sandwiches are made with good ingredients.  They are assembled with care and the combinations are great.  The side of sweet potato chips that come with the sandwiches are crisp and salty.  A few were soggy, but it happens.

So why the low rating?  Severely overpriced.  They don't seem to be hurting for business though so maybe priced appropriately for them?  However, unless you want to pay 13 for a sandwich, just go to Paradise Bakery (I'm not a huge fan of them either but they also make a decent sandwich for 5 dollars less).  

I may go back for hh - their beer and wine selection seems good and well priced between 3-6 and half price shared plates (appetizers).",negative
ch513,1/11/2013,revch1577,5,"The Herb Box is one of my favorite restaurants in Scottsdale. 
The decor is nice and calming and so well applied. The location on the Scottsdale canal is really nice and there's a large patio that takes advantage of this.
The menu has so many different options and tastes that a variety of people will enjoy. There is also a take out area, that has a small markets selling some of the favorites (hummus, salads, etc)
Servers are always helpful, professional and attentive.

Here are some of the menu items I have enjoyed and notes about them. I am disappointed that they took off their Falafel dinner option. It came with two dips, falafel, and a salad. They took it off the menu a little while ago!

Iced Teas- They always have a variety of flavors and they're all well balanced and delicious.

Tzatziki+Hummus+Olives+Pita- Their Red Pepper Hummus has a  nice subtle spice to it, and the white bean artichoke is out of this world awesome. It's not as creamy as most Middle Eastern hummus' I enjoy, but it is a different breed and done so well. The olives are a great variety and the pita is good.

Crisp Falafel with Tahini Yogurt Sauce and Greek Salsa- The falafel aren't heavy or overly spiced, they are very light and so perfect. I actually don't put them in the same vein as other Falafel because they are so different. Same as I wrote about for the hummus. They are some of my favorite falafel though. The Tahini has a subtle lemon flavor and it's incredible. I could eat it with a spoon. I always as for extra Greek Salsa because it's yummy as well. 

Butternut Squash Corn Enchiladas- These are light but filling with incredible ingredients then blend well together (Cojita, Spiced Pecans, Tomatillo- it works)

The Grow Happy Salad- Not your everyday salad. Pepitas, Pepperoncinis. Feta. Just awesome and filling in it's own right.

I want to try Brunch soon. The Red Velvet Pancakes are calling to me.",positive
ch513,1/10/2013,revch1578,4,"I was excited to walk into this restaurant because of how lovely it looked from the outside. The inside of the restaurant is very home-like, with booths that have pillows and varying tables filling the dining area. Came during happy hour and was happy to find that appetizers were half off and specialty drinks, $5. 
The waiter was slow in approaching us and the menu was initially very unsatisfactory. A group of us were actually contemplating getting up to try a different restaurant. The waitress somehow knew what we were planning, came to us just in time to recommend some of the most delicious dishes I've tried in a long time. 

Our table shared the falafel appetizers that my friend described by saying ""there is no meat but they make it taste like it is."" ... more simplistically put...it's good falafel! 

brother got the thai ribs which comes with a side of mac and cheese and apple salad. DELICIOUS. supposedly the best ribs he ever had. 
i shared the serrano-avocado shrimp salad which has the perfect amount of spice and crunch. The shrimp IS fried and the salad is topping two slices of bread though. The shrimp was cooked to perfection and eating half was more than sufficient. 

Would love to come back and eat on their patio!",positive

ch513,1/4/2013,revch1580,5,"Let me start off by saying 5 stars for this place just is not enough! Working at a hotel near old town Scottsdale I am always being asked for good restaurants, and this is the first place I always recommend. Before you even get to the restaraunt you are attracted by the looks, smells, and feel of the bakery in front. With a great wine and bakery selection you are pulled into the restaurant where the atmoshphere is welcoming yet elegant. The hostest welcomes you with a smile and kind words then quickly seats you where you prefer. Weather permitting my first choice is their beautiful patio. The staff quickly serves you and offers you a fresh unique menue. Everything on their menue is all locally grown or raised making every dish as fresh as it gets as well as making their menu seasonal allowing for their choices to rotate through out the year. I have never had an item from the Herb box I would not have again, therefore making the quality of food excellent.
The staff which I already mentioned earlier, is always attentive to your every need, extrordinarily friendly, and completely delightful from the moment they see you until the moment you walk out the door. Making the service excllent.
As far as price, it is reasonable to think you certainly get what you pay for. Being in old town Scottsdale and having the freshest menu definitely can have a bit of sticker shock however, with the quality food and outstanding service, the price is more than worth it. making the value average to above average.
Over all the Herb Box is Excellent!!",positive
ch513,12/24/2012,revch1581,4,"Great food and comfortable atmosphere.

ch513,12/16/2012,revch1583,4,"Great place. We came here as a 9 top and they were able to sit us after 30-45 minutes (reasonable for no reservation in Old town on a Saturday night).  It can get a little crowded in the bar area up front.  

The decor of this place is trendy/classy.  Looks like they took a bunch of props from Anthropologie and threw them in the restaurant and somehow managed to pull of a great rustic yet elegant look.  Go see for yourself!  There was also a live act playing that night - everything from Clapton to Christmas music and while it was great, sometimes it was hard to hear/talk over the music.  Service was great as well - our waitress was able to get us out the door in an hour and a half and that was with check splitting and multiple recurring drink orders!

Now for the food... I was able to try the sliders, thai bbq ribs w/ mac n cheese, and the capicola ham flatbread.  All of it was delicious.  The meat just falls right off the bone on the ribs, and the sauce was fantastic.  Most things are in the 16 - 30 price range.

I would highly recommend The Herb Box.,positive

It's sort of this rustic yet contemporary Cape Cod look and the bathrooms are the best in the city! The service was perfect and the food-- even better. I got the trout with fried spinach and some sort of cheesy vegetable side dish that was amazing. My boyfriend got the spare ribs with mac and cheese. It was equally as good. On and the desert! The trio is a perfect way to end the meal and everything was so good. This is the perfect date night location.",positive

ch513,12/6/2012,revch1587,5,"My husband and I returned to The Herb Box for dinner two days after our first visit.  This time I had the gluten-free Butternut Squash and Corn Enchiladas, which were delicious and satisfying, with a perfect tomatillo sauce.  My husband loved his New York Strip with demi-glace, gorgonzola, green bean & fingerling potato salad w/ red onion, celery & fennel.  For dessert we had a very nice gluten-free lemon meringue pie. Yum!

The cocktail menu is inventive, and we both enjoyed deliciously unique drinks.  The wine menu offers a good variety of foreign wines, but it would be nice to see some nice domestic options, as well.

Once again the service was lovely (thank you, Eric H.!), and the ambience was intimate and relaxing.  We  are looking forward to our return to Scottsdale to sample more of the menu.",positive
ch513,12/4/2012,revch1588,5,"What a great find in the middle of the afternoon!  We were visiting from out of town and went to The Herb Box because of their gluten-free options.  The decor is contemporary and the atmosphere is sophisticated.  Sadie waited on us and gave us excellent service - helpful, warm, and very professional.  I had the short rib soft tacos, and they were wonderful.  My husband had the turkey/avocado wrap, and my stepson ordered the blackened chicken salad, and every bit was gobbled up.  We also ordered a cup of eggplant soup and it was excellent, with a wonderful, smoky flavor.  

For dessert, the chef put together some ice cream sandwiches made of gluten-free chocolate cookies and avocado/mint ice cream.  Delicious!  

We come to Scottsdale at least once a year and will definitely return to The Herb Box for another wonderful meal.  I just wish they would come to Knoxville, Tennessee!",positive

ch513,10/18/2012,revch1591,4,"We have grown to like this Herb Box, but still miss the one up in DC Ranch.  

Don't get me wrong, it's still there.  But when I worked up near DC Ranch, we use to go there all the time.  That location (on Thompson Peak) has a strong Take-out  business mostly because it gets easily crowded with parents with kids.  So on a mild day, the Take-out is the way to go.

Actually, their Take-out  business is called Herb Box Market and it is marketed as a ""food boutique concept that offers customers a worldly and sophisticated retail setting that features an extensive array of freshly prepared meals including the casual catering-to-go line"".  Gabi M has written a glowing Five Star review of their catering business which you can read.

This location in Old Scottsdale also has a Take-out business, but it's downstairs and out of the way and seems less crowded when we've been here for lunch.  

As you walk into The Herb Box, I would readily agree with Andy M, it does feel like you're eating in a Crate & Barrel!   But, that's not a bad thing, nor is it reflected in my Four Star rating.  

One time, we sat near the old style turn of the last century bicycle, with the large front wheel.   All I could think about during our meal was that 60's TV show, with Patrick McGoohan called ""The Prisoner"".  LOL

We've had most of the items on the menu, but tend to gravitate to the Smoked Turkey Ciabatta ($12.00) with gouda cheese, bacon, sweet tomato and roasted red pepper aioli mayo which was very tasty.  It comes with sweet potato chips which are delicious.  Ask your server for a side of the red pepper aioli sauce for dipping.  It's mildly spicy, but works well with the chips.

We have also tried their Blackened Chicken Caesar Salad ($13.00).  It's slightly different then the other blackened chicken we've tried, but nice.  It comes with romaine lettuce, dried cherries, cotija, tortilla strips and a chipotle-parmesan vinaigrette.  I really believe it's the dried cherries that work best with the dressing that make the salad, but I would skip the tortilla strips.

The other entree we seem to enjoy is their Turkey Apple Swiss Wrap ($13.00) it has Turkey with dried cranberries, smoked bacon, and greens.  It also comes with sweet potato chips.  Remember the aioli mayo!

The wait staff is very good at The Herb Box and they work very hard at anticipating drink refills.  We sat in John's section for our last visit and he was great!

Enjoy!",positive
ch513,10/14/2012,revch1592,1,"I have to say after seeing all these positive reviews it makes me even more disappointed that I had just an unpleasant experience. 

My friends and I came here yesterday to grab a quick bite to eat and a few drinks.  We came around 3 or 4 in the afternoon so it was very quite.  It was our first time so when we walked in we were not sure if it was open seating or what so after being ignored for a few minutes we just decided to have a seat.  When we sat down again no one came to greet us or give us menus so we politely asked what appeared to be a host for some menus.  This woman was soo rude, she didn't even say one word to us all she did was glare back (how dare we bother her for a menu, the nerve!) until another employee offered to get us some menus and waters.  After that my friends and I were already feeling very unwelcomed but still took a look at the menu.  Again the same woman walked by our table looked directly at us, rolled her eyes, shook her head and then darted into some back room. (SERIOUSLY! is that a joke?!)  Now at this point I was so upset and our server also  hadn't been back to check on us after several minutes( I'm not exaggerating, there was one othe so we just got up and left all together.  

I can honestly say they have lost my business forever and I will NEVER recommend this place to any of my friends or family. 

Super disappointing.  What ever happened to good customer service??",negative
ch513,10/4/2012,revch1593,5,"Delicious! This place was so good and had many decently health options. I went for lunch to celebrate a co-workers birthday and will definitely be back. Interested to see what their dinner menu is like.

ch513,10/2/2012,revch1594,5,"So I yelped up this place and looked at their website and had to take my honey to this restaurant! Wow it was wonderful. The Salmon cake with corn pablano was a feast for the eyes and for the palate.
The Thai ribs with fingerling potatoes had a sauce with just the right amount of spice. The meat was fall off the bone perfect and juicy. Perfect is perfect!
With a good cocktail,  Pama vodka and a nice simple single malt. What more can you say!

ch513,10/1/2012,revch1595,2,"Overpriced. Unrefined. Disappointment. To me ""Herb Box"" would invoke fresh, clean, seasonal flavors. This reminded me more of that other restaurant with the name ""Box"" in it.

It seems like it has a lot of potential but they need to drop their prices and drop the deep fryer. It's a lot of fluff without much substance.

Started with the Asparagus and Fennel Frites - aka, beer battered and greasy hunks of vegetable served in a basket with fake newspaper.

Husband had the trout. Said it was good, and the side was a cheesey asparagus casserole. Came with spinach, which again was fried.

I had the Halibut special. Fish was amazing  with a little tapenade on top but the fingerling potatoes were essentially home fries. No veggies on this entree unless you count the olives. 

Server was friendly but I should have known to ask the price on the halibut before ordering it. Atmosphere was sophisticated, but the giant flat screen detracted from what could be a really elegant dining experience.",negative

ch513,9/10/2012,revch1597,3,"My BFF and I had been wanting to eat here so we decided to stop in for lunch after a dress fitting at Destiny's Bride across the way.

This place is super cute inside (even the bathrooms were impressive), the perfect atmosphere for a ladies lunch.

We were immediately seated and our drink order was taken. However, I was a little disappointed at how long it took the server to visit our table again. I made eye contact with him and managed to say ""come on man,we're ready to order"" without using any words at all. He acknowledged me and explained that he would be right over (I think he was carrying a tray of drinks for another table at the time). While he offered to share the specials (which I had been very interested in hearing about when we first sat down), my friend and I had both settled on a choice from the regular menu and were ready to get the show on the road.

I ordered the butternut squash enchiladas. The server had mentioned that it was one of the best things on the menu, but if that's the case -- bummer. My thoughts? The squash was undercooked, the tomatillo sauce was delicious but lukewarm at best (as was the filling). The mixed greens on the plate were sprinkled  with cotija cheese and dressed with some multicolored bell peppers, fresh and delicious. Maybe I should've ordered a salad instead?

BFF got the grilled chicken and sage pesto sandwich.Of course I had a bite... DELICIOUS! She was expecting the chicken to be warm; it was cold, but still a tasty sandwich. I'm pretty sure it was on ciabatta bread (love it) and was dressed with goat cheese, gala apples, and bacon. YUM! It came with sweet potato chips too and I couldn't keep myself from stealing another and another from her plate. I would definitely order this next time. 

The server was always friendly, but I get the feeling that maybe he was taking care of too many tables at once. I've seen other comments on yelp addressing the service so perhaps this is an issue that needs to be addressed (ATTN: Management). I was, however, impressed that the server noticed a birthday gift sitting on our table and offered to bring a birthday treat. It was a chocolate cupcake with white frosting and a chocolate shell on top. DELICIOUS!! Reminded me of a chocolate hostess cupcake (I'm a sucker for those things).

ch513,9/5/2012,revch1598,4,"I have hard of the Her Box or so long I finally decided to give it a shot with the gf for a nice litte dinner. I have to say I was impressed. Great service and the waiter (Andy?) was not only one of the most helpful waiters (in terms of being honest about his favorites on the menu) but also one of the funniest. So much so that I asked him if he thought about being a stand up comedian (which usually doesn't across as a compliment but was one). I had the advocado love which was three slightly toasted servings of advocado with some arugula and a few green jalepenos (which I wasn't aware of until I bit on one...). Only negative about that dish which was delicious is that I wish the bread was slightly more toasted so it would hold the advocado and salad better. I also ordered the smoked gouda mac and cheese. I'm familiar with gouda as it's basically a staple cheese where I grew up similar to cheddar here and it was as close to being perfect as it could be. Served with some bread crumbs and really delicious. The gf had a flatbread,corn and goat cheese which was equally as good. I'm not much for desserts for the most part and the dessert menu did look great, but the gf managed to request one, the smorees creme brulee. I'm not sure it was a complete success...edible yes but most creme brulee comes somewhat warm and the consistency was good but more like a pudding than what I was expecting. I love bread pudding but didn't try it and the serve highly recommended the crack pie which I'll have to come back for and test out. Despite the somewhat pricey menu, I'd say it was a pleasant surprise and well worth all the reviews and high marks.",positive
ch513,8/26/2012,revch1599,1,"IF you want a waitress that puts you down for complaining that the mac and cheese is cold EAT HERE!  ""Personally I would't eat it, it's too hot for my taste."" As she sets it down after they re heated the mac.  UMMM....Yeah I LOVE eating cold mac and cheese. ( THE NEXT DAY! as left overs!)
My husband ordered the steak salad and  he asked for it to be cooked medium, but it came out raw.  My flat bread was burnt almost black, and crispy, not the way I would or anyone with food sense would eat it.


The only thing good about this is place that the one star gets is the lemonade mango juice.",negative
ch513,8/16/2012,revch1600,5,"LOVED this place! 

This is hands down the best service I have ever gotten at a restaurant.  Now granted it was the middle of a weekday, but the waiter was nice, attentive, and he even gave us directions to a bar we were trying to find (not for that day, but for another time).

I had an amazing cocktail.  It was basically a mojito but used tequila  instead.  Which was perfect.  It took away some of the sweetness of a mojito and gave it a bit more body.  

I was there with a family member and we split Asparagus and Fennel Frites and the Butternut Squash Corn Enchiladas.  Both I thought were pretty good.   I really liked the fennel, just because it was something a little bit different.  The enchiladas had a little spice to them but not a ton.  They were very flavorful though.",positive
ch609,1/6/2015,revch1601,4,we were starving and stumbled upon this cute little place for lunch. The service was great and the food was delicious! Fresh and presented beautifully. Even had dessert- chocolate bread pudding - wow. Priced very reasonably for what it was. Yum!,positive
ch609,1/4/2015,revch1602,4,"This is another place that I'm kicking myself for not trying sooner.

I think I need to start a ""Thanks to Lisa E."" list because here's another spot that I discovered because of her. Truth be told, Rusconi's has been on my bookmark list for a while, but Lisa expedited my introduction to this awesome place.

True, it's in a strip mall but they've done a fantastic job with the space and the result is a classy/cozy spot to eat.  Their menu is a farm to table concept with creative entrees using fresh ingredients. They have a small bar which is a fun place to position yourself. They have a good wine selection and the friendly bartenders whip up some tasty hand-crafted cocktails.

I had the roasted sea scallops which were good sized, and served with baby cabbage in a delicious glaze.  They have some other amazing entrees....the tenderloin is on my ""to try"" list for next time. And though I don't eat lamb, I have to admit that their lamb dishes sound intriguing and delicious.

This is really a great spot for a date, or a group or family meal. HIGHLY recommend!",positive

ch609,12/28/2014,revch1604,3,"I was surprised that such a well reviewed restaurant was so quiet on the Sunday between Christmas and New Year's. The salmon sliders were very tasty.  My husband was not so impressed with his Huevos rancheros nor did my daughter like her chicken tenders.   My other daughter did enjoy her pancakes though I wish it was served with a side of fruit or something. 

Also service was a bit spotty though they were very nice. They did not bring the crayons for the children's menus that had activities that we had to request. My husband also never received his Diet Coke.",negative
ch609,12/23/2014,revch1605,4,"This place is awesome, if you want a home cooked meal, or just simply good food.  The salmon was so good and the smell of the wood grill makes you crave for the food even greater.  Can't wait to go back!",positive
ch609,12/9/2014,revch1606,5,"This is one of our favorite restaurants.  The quality is excellent, while the prices are very reasonable:  one of the best values in town.   Plenty of delicious, creative main courses in the $15-25 range.  The portions are just right, not ridiculously large or small.  Wine prices are reasonable, and some nights get the whole bottle for half price.  Pretty much everything we have tried here is excellent, and we've been here around 6x and tried a range of dishes.  Friendly servers, very nice atmosphere.  Ex-Lon's chef--one of our other favorite restaurants.  The kind of quality, atmosphere and pricing that one wants to go to and yet can afford to go to frequently.",positive

All was good, just not over the top in terms of excellent service.  The hostess did good, the server did good and the food was 3.5-4 stars.  Salmon was good but didnt have the wild caught flavor of most salmon I've personally caught.  Maybe the salmon they serve is a different species.  No worries. Still very good.  I had the tenderloin speciality prepared very nicely over a grits and feta concoction.  Excellent flavors....just not super hot when it arrived at the table.  Over all setting is nice....nothing super wow in terms of romantic, but comfortable.  Yes, I would recommend for very good food at a very fair price.",negative

I started with the pork belly appetizer and they had the Kitchen Board.  They were both wonderful! The server was engaging my 7 year old niece while we enjoyed the appetizers and cocktails.  My sister and her husband split the mussels and I had the beef tenderloins with the intention of bringing some home....nope!  I ate every last bit!  We finished with the warm bread pudding and it was to die for!  Fantastic food, wonderful service and a great experience.  I told my sister that was one of the best meals I have ever had!",positive

Rusconi's is a true gem. I had the sirloin tips while my girlfriend had the salmon.  Now these aren't your ordinary dishes: for example, my sirloin tips sat on a delicious bed of truffle scented mac and cheese.  

I also liked that they don't serve over-sized huge portions.  The portions are just big enough so you have room for...wait for it.....the chocolate bread pudding. 

The service was also excellent.  Our waiter was very funny, offered great suggestions, and always on point to fill our water and wine glasses.

ch609,11/15/2014,revch1612,5,One of the best hidden treasures that I've found in Phoenix.  Truly a neighborhood vibe and a very nice break from the downtown Scottsdale crowd.  The scallops and short rib that we had were to die for.  I've been here twice now and the service is always amazing.,positive
ch609,11/14/2014,revch1613,5,"Holy moley, this place is fantastic!

My mother and I went here after a really hard day. We were depressed, and a little down. Starting with fantastic appetizer (some sort of beef dish with vanilla potatoes), our mood improved. I capped it off with this fantastic pork dish, coupled with sweet potato risotto. By the time I was considering dessert (I declined, too full), my earlier foul mood was all but gone!

With fantastic service and a wine list I definitely want to go back and explore further, this counts as one of the best dining experiences I've had to date. The menu is gorgeous, and I wish I could have tried everything.

Nothing improves a bad day like stick-to-your-ribs New American food, fresh and warm from the kitchen. I'm definitely going back here.",positive

ch609,11/1/2014,revch1617,4,We loved this place!  We sat at the bar and the service and food were both spectacular.  The short rib appetizer was so flavorful and tender- the best I've ever had.  The salmon was perfection!  The only reason for 4 instead of 5 stars is because the portion sizes are a little on the small side... Our plates were licked clean and I would've loved a bite or two to take home.  We can't wait to go back!,positive

Nice atmosphere with a small patio, ample bar space with seating and a large dining room overlooking the kitchen.  The service was efficient, friendly and led us in the right direction when making our menu choices.

We started with the grilled peach and goat cheese fondue and the amish blue cheese and apple salad...both were delicious!  We shared our server's two favorite entrees - the salmon with blackberry glaze served with potatoes, carrots and brussel sprouts & the natural chicken served with green chili risotto and carrots.  Both were simple, flavorful and downright tasty.

ch609,9/21/2014,revch1629,2,"Truffle fries, gourmet burgers, hints of Asian fusion here and there, and food served on plates with four corners.  This is enough to make some people thrilled about a restaurant already.  However, when everybody else seems to be doing the the same thing, each one needs to stand out in some way.  Rusconi's didn't.

THE GIST: Modern American menu / Inconsistent seasoning / Service needs work

FOOD HIGHLIGHTS

Goat Cheese Fondue with Pita Bread: The fondue was good, the pita bread used to dip it was not.  Our first batch had lukewarm pita bread that had a chewy, dare-I-say microwaved consistency.  After our table finished the first round of pita bread, they were kind enough to offer a second; this batch came out burnt, but this time with a sitting-on-the-counter-too-long consistency.

Cheeseburger with Fries: Several members of my party ordered this one, one of them asking for no salt on the fries.  Everybody else got crunchy, but very salty fries.  Her order seemed to have a batch of unsalted fries sitting atop a batch of salted fries, because there was definitely salt at the bottom of her bowl.  The burger itself was unremarkable.

Ossobuco: This was the special for the night.  Unlike the fries, it was incredibly under-seasoned and rather dry.  I got it to taste a bit better with some salt, but dry ossobuco is pretty hard to get through as is.  Not recommended.

CONCLUSION

It's trendy, it's big, and it's American, but there are too many places pulling this concept off correctly for me to recommend this to anyone.",negative

ch609,9/12/2014,revch1631,5,"WOW! Service was excellent, food was divine, and atmosphere was incredibly charming. I had the Ahi Tuna and it was as fresh and tender as if I was seating at some seaside cafe (as opposed to being in the middle of the desert). The location is in the middle of a stretch mall / plaza type situation with Panda Express on one side and a pizzeria on the other, which really makes you question it at first. But nope, this is just one oddly placed gem!",positive

We wanted a low top table but they wanted to sit us at the bar with a hightop table, another employee overheard and gave us a low top table we're seated right away.. The chef made a amazing meal the food was excellent. I had the beef medallions and my friend had the baked chicken and Rice. The portion were very small so I was still hungry when we were done.  Our service was slow took about 10m to get a glass of water and another five more minutes to get our beer & soda. She never did ask us if we wanted another drink. The check in offer was just for brunch :( so I didn't check in. The bar tender was awesome!! Made a few killer coffee martinis.. I took a picture of him so you be able to see who the excellent bartender was...

ch609,8/18/2014,revch1638,5,"Ate here for brunch before heading back home this weekend. This was one of the best brunch menus I have seen. They had all the classics, as well as a few specialties. I ate the ginger and lemon pancakes and they were amazing. So much better than normal pancakes, the flavor was out of this world. It was served with hibiscus infused syrup and walnut flavored butter, both added great elements to a usually basic dish. It was very refreshing tasting. Others at the table had the short rib bendict and huevos rancheros. Both of them finished their plates and raved about it. The service was excellent as well. Wish this place was in Dallas!",positive
ch609,8/17/2014,revch1639,5,"I have to admit the first time we went, the family were not big fans.  Over one year later, we have been back three times in six weeks.  Most recently, August 6, my wife and I sat at the bar and enjoyed Dave's company along with the Scottish salmon and tuna entrees, Romaine salad and the Caramel topped custard, oh ya and of course a few glasses of wine.  Everything was excellent.  So excellent, we were back on the 13th for exactly the same meal, except we both opted for the salmon this time...again excellent and we were pleasantly surprised with the price.

ch609,7/30/2014,revch1642,5,"Our second time here and it has been a 5 star experience on both visits.  It has become a must visit locale on our annual trek to Phoenix. Why?  The food is wonderful, the service attentive and the price points for such extraordinarily prepared and delicious food very reasonable.  The owner/chef and his wife show a great pride of ownership and the diner is the beneficiary of their endeavor.  
Thanks to Nancy who took our reservation, we were seated at the community kitchen table which allows one to see the prep operation, line chef and waiters kitchen interaction-normally an operation that takes place behind closed doors.  This approach makes the staff much more in tune with the food and the patrons they serve.  Approachable, answering questions about ingredients etc., the proximity to the kitchen operation adds a new dimension to ones dining experience.  (The majority of tables are located away from the action if that's not your thing however.)   We love it and recommend trying it!
The food... There were no misses!  Two of us had the set menu, four courses for $40.00 that offered all the most favorite dishes mentioned in the majority of the reviews here.  From the salmon to the macaroni-it was well worth it.  One had the pork tenderloin which was moist and flavorful.   I forgot to mention the fine martinis, try the pear martini!  Bookmark this restaurant, pay it a visit and enjoy a great evening.  Very nice and hardworking owners that deserve your patronage for delivering beautiful, flavorful food at a reasonable price.

Yes,  the strip mall facade is fooling,  once inside we were pleasantly surprised.   We sat at the community kitchen table for fun,  let me tell you....the kitchen manager or expeditor runs a tight ship there. 
I started with the special salad of the evening,  blue cheese stuffed figs,  wrapped in prosciutto on arugula,  it was a perfect starter.   I then had the salmon,  which was cooked to perfection at medium rare,  hard to do with a thick cut.   It was perfect.   My daughter and husband both had delicious burgers,  not my thing at a good restaurant,  but their Angus meat had great flavor.....And of course who could say anything bad about Truffle Fries!!!!   Other than I finished theirs and I shouldn't have,  but they were too good not to.   
After being unable to breath,  I couldn't say no to trying the Dark Chocolate Bread Pudding,  key word for me here was Dark.   It was so good,  yep polished it off.",positive
ch609,7/18/2014,revch1644,5,"The food here is incredible! We had the special appetizer, which was bleu cheese stuffed and bacon wrapped figs, the beef medallions and another special, the pork osso buco. Every dish was fantastic. The beef medallions came with truffle mac and cheese that was worth a diary entry on it's own. 
The only thing I didn't love was the wine selection. I had the only Zinfandel by the glass, sledgehammer and think there are much better choices to put on the menu in the same price range.

We will be back.",positive

My family are sharers and had to take everyone's food, and boy was that a good idea!! Not one person was disappointed!

ch609,7/11/2014,revch1647,5,"Tucked away in the shopping plaza across from Whole Foods by Tatum and Shea is a little gem called Rusconi's American Kitchen.  I happened up this place because after dropping the toddler off we were desperate for a decent meal and some adult time.  I had never heard of this restaurant before and I drive by there often but I saw it had good reviews on Yelp and it was right during their happy hour time.  My husband and I were thrilled with the food we had, the prices were great and the service was attentive.

To start off our journey we ordered the American goat cheese and artichoke fondue with wood grilled flatbread.  Talk about creamy goodness that you can't stop eating, this is it.  You want to order this when you stop by, it warms you up and comforts your soul.  Then we tried out the slow roasted pork belly and shreiners sausage with poblano glaze, creamy polenta and grilled apple relish.  I am such a big fan of pork belly, I couldn't resist, the pork belly was crispy and popped with flavor.  Sharing the boneless beef short rib sliders with horseradish cream and smoke gouda, was hard because they're just that good.  Can I also say that I love their french fries!

I went back there for lunch not too long ago and enjoyed their roasted beef tenderloin with baby greens, fingerling potatoes, olives, green beans and onions.  So vibrant with color and taste.  I'll tell you what I tell all my friends, try it out!",positive

I have been there a couple times now, the first time during restaurant week to give it a try, and I was pleasantly surprised. I do not like to give five stars unless a place really wows me, and this place did, mostly from the food and the service perspective. The service was fantastic, and the food was very, very good. You can tell a lot of love from Chef Michael Rusconi and his staff went into the food. Nice size portions, and lot's of flavor, and very well priced. I was expecting an expensive meal, and I was surprised at how affordable it was, great value for what you get. 

Although the interior is nice, it deserves a structure with a lot more character besides a spot in a strip mall. But then again, the food and service is so good, you forget about the surroundings. This is now one of my favorite restaurants in the valley.",positive

ch609,5/28/2014,revch1656,5,"AMAZING food and service. Taylor is our favorite waiter. The menu changes frequently and each dish is better than the last. We took our preschoolers with us because it was a family birthday celebration and for an upscale restaurant they were so very accommodating , making the best Mac n cheese for them and even an adorable flower apple plate because my 4 year old asked for apples and Mac n cheese even though it was not on the menu. We also have stopped by for just drinks And desert and the bartender is excellent. Our favorite neighborhood place !",positive

ch609,5/15/2014,revch1658,5,Wow. The food was fantastic. I loved the salmon. It was a special occasion and the service made the evening more special. Great fun.,positive
ch609,5/11/2014,revch1659,5,"Decided on Rusconi's for a group dinner of 6 people; I called the day before to make the reservation. The man I spoke to said they were a little booked, but could accommodate us on the patio; I said no problem. Well, upon arriving the next night, we were told by the hostess that she couldn't find the reservation. I explained to her the conversation I'd had the evening before and almost immediately she went wide eyed and started to apologize. Basically, there had been a miscommunication on their end and early in the day, she had cancelled our reservation by accident.

As soon as she realized the mistake, she went to talk to her manager about how to fix the situation. After a little waiting maybe 10-15 minutes (another table had to clear out), we were escorted to a table right next to the kitchen. The restaurant is much smaller than I thought it would be, but it was elegantly decorated and very nice.

Right away, the manager sent over 2 of the ""kitchen board"" appetizers to further beg pardon for the mix up. It was filled with a selection of delicious cheeses, meats, bread and pickled veggies. I was especially impressed with the duck they served, as it was ""smoked"" underneath an upside lowball glass . Right before they serve it to you, the chef actually takes smoke and pipes it into the glass, filling it up so you can't see the meat. Then, they serve it to you, the waiter removes the glass and you consume. And you could definitely taste the smoke (in a good way).

Afterwards, our main courses arrived and all at our table were satisfied. Between us we tried the: tenderloin beef medallions, veggie & goat cheese ravioli, roasted chicken, blackberry glazed salmon and a massive cheese burger. All agreed that the food was super delicious. I can only speak for the beef but it was truly amazing. Easily one of the best cooked pieces of meat I've ever had. Truffle mac & cheese was fantastic too, as were the carrots with a yummy glaze.

All in all, a great experience. Could have gone the other way, but Rusconi's handled it perfectly. It's a little out the way for me to eat there too regularly (although I licked my plate clean and it was not a small portion, so maybe that's a good thing). However, I will definitely be back for another special occasion!",positive
ch609,5/10/2014,revch1660,5,"Not a great location, don't love the sign, but once you get past that you are in for a treat.  Great design and atmosphere, only enhanced by the delicious smell that attacks your senses approximately 1 step into the restaurant.  Staff is professional and attentive.  The menu has options with great range and really leave you in a predicament.  We had the salmon and the lamb.  Lamb was really good, but the salmon is incredible. Wine list is fairly priced and has the half bottle option on some great Cabs.  Only recommendation (outside of location and sign), is a shake up of the starters menu.  Kudos and I hope you are here for a long time!",positive
ch609,5/10/2014,revch1661,3,"Food was good, but I thought slightly under seasoned. Seating is slightly crammed which I didn't care for. Service was very good and it was easy to get a reservation. Nice place for a date and prices were good.",negative

Would also like to mention that Dave, the bartender was very accommodating!  He surprised me with a cocktail that he overheard me talking about to my husband. It was a great surprise and definitely made a good impression on us. We'll def be going back for an actual lunch or dinner :)",positive

ch609,4/7/2014,revch1670,5,"Thanks to all the yelpers a friend and I had brunch here on a Sunday, when I realized it was in a strip mall I was a little surprised, but once I found the Restuarant it had all the ambiance of a 5 star Restuarant. So welcoming, beautiful, opened to the outside, ski lights, etc. who ever designed this place knew what they were doing. Neither of us were very hungry so we opted to split a crab and egg Benedict. I asked for the muffin to be replaced with spinach. It came with beautiful fingerling potatoes and was simply Devine.  The service, staff, entree, filtered watered, we were even asked if we wanted lemons. It was absolutely delightful. The Chef came out and thanked a party of 8 for coming out every Sunday. It has such a warm, and cheerful environment.",positive
ch609,3/31/2014,revch1671,4,"Hidden little gem tucked away in a shopping center.  I've been here for dinner twice, and lunch about 3 times.  I love it.  Service is always great.  Food is terrific and the price is reasonable.

On my first night dining here, the waiter got my order wrong (salmon instead of lamb...he even brought out the steak knife to cut the lamb).  It wasn't a big deal, and I ate/enjoyed the salmon anyway.  Regardless, he comp'd me for the dish and also gave us dessert.  Class act.  That gesture also brought me back several times after that.

I would definitely recommend....I just wish they were in a better location.",positive
ch609,3/30/2014,revch1672,5,"Wow.  I had the roast salmon.  It was so good.  Best I've ever had.  My wife ordered the scallops.  They were even better, though I wouldn't have believed that was possible had she not shared a little with me.

The service was very attentive.

The best thing was how thoughtful and fun our waiter was.  Our 9 year old doesn't always feel comfortable in a ""grownup's restaurant,"" but our waiter engaged so thoughtfully and nicely with her that she had a fantastic time.  Our other two were also struck, saying afterward that ""the waiter was just so nice!""

The owner came by the table and introduced himself as well.  He made the children feel welcome and thought of.  He told our youngest that if she didn't find what she wanted on the desert menu, they would make anything they had the ingredients for.

Back to the food.  The desserts were great.  My wife got the chocolate bread pudding.  I got the, Hm..., carmel and fruit covered pudding.  It was all delicious.  You wanted to just close your eyes and enjoy how good it was.  (Actually, I did.)",positive
ch609,3/17/2014,revch1673,5,Took my family here for dinner while I was in town visiting... delicious. Absolutely fantastic. Every single bite of every single dish blew me away. The chef here clearly has a taste for the divine. Do not pass this place up.,positive
ch609,3/13/2014,revch1674,5,"Wow, what a find in Phoenix!  Awesome variety of the menu of new American classics!  Had the porcini mushroom soup with creme foam and black shaven truffles- yum!  Candy striped beet salad looked awesome.  Had the guajillo braised duck over foie gras and a pumpkin pancake - sooooo yummy! Hubby had the roasted chicken with the green chile Mac and cheese - sooo good!   They also had so many tantalizing dishes such as shrimp and grits, truffle oil Mac and cheese, wonderful salads, cheese platters and appetizers that you can do tapa's style and share!  We went on Sunday, wine bottles are half off - SCORE!!  Great wine selection, another plus, great friendly attentive service, another plus.....dessert, chocolate mousse with salted caramel drizzle!!   Back to the gym after this place!!   Great restaurant, will be back",positive
ch609,3/8/2014,revch1675,5,"It's not often I give a restaurant 5 stars but Rusconi's American Kitchen earned one. Recommended by some friends we decided to have dinner here on our last night in town. Clearly don't get swayed by the store front of the building or the fact that it's in a strip mall and next door to a sandwich shop. Once you step inside the door you'll be pleasantly surprised and understand what I'm talking about. 

The inside of the restaurant has a warm feeling and the smell of wood fire and delicious food will quickly overwhelm you. The acoustics are perfect too. A little noise but not too much and you can easily carry on a conversation.

Our group decided on a variety of items on the menu. We started with the Artisan cheese. A generous assortment of meats, cheese, olives and roasted peppers. It was accompanied with grilled crostini. For entrees I just couldn't resist their version of a meatless lasagna. It's nothing like what you might expect. It's a tasty dish with a variety of veggies along with a few sheets of homemade pasta. It was delicious and something I could eat every night!

My hubby ordered the roasted salmon. The glaze was sweet and the ""mixture of tastes and textures was an amazing combination"". Others tried the mushroom soup and commented, ""the best they'd ever had"". The seared scallops were ""incredible"" and served on top of a bed of cauliflower puree. Service was exceptional and each one of our dishes was prepared perfectly.

This place is a gem. Certainly a winner in every category for me.",positive
ch609,3/7/2014,revch1676,5,"Went in here for dinner tonight and will definitely be back!  First off, looks can be deceiving!  When we pulled up we thought it looked pretty small and casual but inside was much bigger and not too casual but not too fancy that I felt out of place.  Our server was Bobby and he was superb!  Great personality, friendly, helpful and on top of everything!  

I ordered the tenderloin medallions with truffle Mac n cheese and carrots/green beans.  Melt in your mouth good!  Even though I was full after half I finished it off because it was so yummy I didn't want to waste it.  My daughter got the cheeseburger and mashed potatoes and those were very good as well.  Had the chocolate bread pudding and some Italian custard thing for dessert.  Everything was freaking phenomenal!  Seriously.... Sooo good!  

The drinks were interesting... The pear martini was very good but there was a special martini that Bobby made us.  It had Red Stag, pineapple juice, grenadine and smoke.  I've never had a smoke drink before but it was such a cool touch plus it tasted amazing!  

Wish I lived closer but I will definitely make the trip up to Scottsdale occasionally for this treat!",positive
ch609,3/5/2014,revch1677,4,"Went with friends last night. Actually did starters and wine at home first, so not looking for a huge meal.

Busy, moderately loud, had to wait 15+ minutes for our 8PM reservation. Not a problem, though.

Our waiter was very attentive at first, but then was a bit hard to find. I think he had too many tables in the busy back.

Thoroughly enjoyed our meals. For me, a non-meat eater (and the menu does lean towards meat and chicken), the Ravioli on veggies with Goat Cheese was excellent. Al dente, even needing a knife assist, but not under-done. My wife had the Ntural Chicken dish - looked very meaty and moist. Our friends had the mussels and the Osso Bucco.

Let's put it this way - not a scrap left on any plate! But alas, no room for the desserts that looked so good. Maybe next time. And there will be a next time.

And a nice bonus - moderate cost. WIth a bottle of wine, $65 per couple, incl tax and tip.",positive
ch609,2/20/2014,revch1678,5,"Excellent! Great variety to choose from. Wonderful presentation. 
Knowledgeable waitstaff with helpful recommendations on combination of first & second courses and wine to go with both. Perfect!
Delicious everything!",positive
ch609,2/17/2014,revch1679,3,"I ordered the same meal I had last year and it wasn't BAD but it wasn't as good either. Last year I had the Brunch Salmon plate. (see photos) Last year it was nice and succulent. This year for dinner it was a smaller portion that was cooked just OK and was topped with Blackberry Glaze and oily fried cilantro. The vegetables under it weren't so tasty. I had slightly burnt tasting brussels sprouts a few over cooked carrot slices and one and one half fingerling potatoes. Maybe I'm old fashioned but when I go out to dinner I expect to receive at least a female weight watcher portion of food. That means I expect 4-5 oz of protein, half a cup of vegetables and 3 oz of potato. That one and one half fingerling potato sort of insulted me. Could you imagine having a dinner party and serving your guest only one and one half fingerling potatoes a person?

We started with the White Truffle Scented Mac-N-Cheese. It lacked Cheese and wasn't cheesy enough and the Truffle aroma didn't bring anything to the party. The pasta was slightly over done. I would not recommend this dish to anyone.

My husband had the Pork Osso Bucco. He said the braised cabbage was very good and the Osso Bucco was seasoned nicely but it wasn't as tender as they usually are. He also said the mashed potatoes were a little bland.

We shared a deep chocolate Bread Pudding with vanilla ice cream. I will say the vanilla sauce on the bread pudding was very good. I'm sure the bread pudding was home made but it had a flavor to it that tasted like cake mix to me. I liked the shaved white chocolate topping on it.

Service was good during most of dinner but at the end it turned diner style. Our waiter placed the check on the table with a dessert and didn't ask me if I wanted coffee or an after dinner drink.

Highly recommended for a nice night out.,positive
ch609,2/11/2014,revch1682,2,"I really don't understand all the five or four star reviews.  We came for happy hour.  Maybe we're spoiled by the bigger cheaper drinks and amazing food at places like Postino's and other North Central Phoenix restaurants.  We only wanted an app or two, but ordered three because I had that sense we would never make it here again, so thought we should try just one more thing. 
The place is pretty.  And the base ingredients seem better and fresher than many other places around Tatum & Shea, but that's why we don't eat around here much. :(  Wish we had a reason to, would be so convenient with all the grocery shopping we do around this particular intersection.",negative
ch609,2/9/2014,revch1683,5,One of the best restuarants I have been to in the area. It doesnt look like anything special from the outside being in a strip mall and between a panda express and another fast food place so im glad someone had recommended we go there. The service is exceptional and the food is very fresh. First time I had chicken and it was so good! We went back recently and I was disappointed t hear they were out of chicken but I ended up getting the grouper special and it was very good!  So glad we discovered this!,positive
ch609,2/7/2014,revch1684,5,"Had the most fantastic dinner.  I had the ahi special, my sister-in-law had mouth watering scallops.  For dessert I had the chocolate creme brûlée...unbelievable!

My wife and I stopped in just after the Christmas Holiday.  Of course we sat at the bar and ordered some apps and cocktails. The Foie with the savory donut was the bomb!  Pork Belly was great also.

This visit I had The Tenderloin Medallions, you could practically cut them with a fork. Served over Rusconi's Mac-n-cheese with truffle oil. Also, grilled Asparagus and carrots. The veggies were done perfectly and if you are looking for a quick snack, grab the appetizer size of Mac-n-cheese, super great! It definitely is not velveeta! 

Definitely make reservations. This is a bustling, busy place.",positive

My husband had the beef medallions with to die for Mac and cheese. My 3 year old didn't care for her chicken strips( were a bit overcooked) but loved the New York strip and Brussel sprouts.

Can't wait to go back.",positive
ch609,1/1/2014,revch1694,2,"We were in Arizona for three days, and unfortunately I hardly had one good meal in this state.  In search for good food for fair prices, we came here.  We got the mushroom soup, pork belly, buffalo steak, their creme brulee, and coffee.  
We arrived here with high hopes, which were crushed pretty quickly.  We were sat by the back door which was propped open on a very cold night.  So after sitting here for a little while, I asked for my boyfriend's jacket, and soon after, he had to go to the car to get another jacket so that we would both be covered.  

Once we ordered our food, we had to wait a good while before the waiter came with the first course: pork belly and sausage.  He simply put the plate down on the table and walked away.  He didn't say here's your first course, or describe the meal, it felt to me as if he almost threw the plate in front of me.  

The sausage was good, but both my boyfriend and I thought the pork belly was overdone, and it wasn't quite as fatty as we usually like.  

Next was the soup and the buffalo.  We asked for the buffalo to be medium rare, which it wasn't.  It was cooked to medium with the last one third of it being well-done.  

The soup while well seasoned and flavorful, seemed to lack body and depth. 

Next we ordered coffee, which came to us almost cold, and the waiter never offered to refill our cup.  We also got the creme brulee since our waiter suggested it.  The creme was a trio: a vanilla, chocolate, and a pumpkin.   All three shared two problems: the sugar had been laid on a very thick layer, resulting on a think candy like crust instead of the mere crunch a proper creme brule would have.  The texture was also unpleasant, and it seemed like the eggs had curdled a bit, so it wasn't as smooth as I like.  Moreover, the pumpkin one really didn't taste that good at all. 

We wouldn't recommend this place to anyone.",negative

After I walked through the door I ditched my first impression.  
The restaurant was very busy but they quickly got us a table.  We were promptly and cheerfully greeted by our server Tommy.  He was a lot of fun and gave us some great suggestions that we took him up on.  
We shared the Kitchen Burger and the Osso Bucco.  Neither disappointed.  The Kitchen Burger had a great fresh taste.  We ordered it with the fries and the lemon aioli that it came with was amazing.  The Osso Bucco was to die for and it was paired nicely with asparagus, whipped mashed potatoes and this delicious prickly pair cabbage.  Tommy checked on us several times throughout the meal and was extremely friendly each time.

Consistently good food.  Always a couple of favorites on the menu with a few featured/specials/seasonal items peppered in.  Everything is very good.  Prices are really reasonable.

We had the scallops and the buffalo sirloin this time with, my favorite, a side of prickly pear cabbage (please don't ever take that off your menu).  Total dinner price for two entrees, a side and (non-alcocholic) drinks = ~$60.  Can't beat that!",positive

ch609,11/5/2013,revch1707,5,"Wow! Mr. Rusconi you genious! This place is quickly becoming my favorite spot in the valley. Have been there 3-4 times and have loved it everytime. The last visit, we got the pork belly appetizer to share and me and the wife got the Beef tenderloin with white truffle mac n cheese and the Lamb Chops with lamb stew (yes!, two big lamb chops in a gravy with lamb stew meat) respectively, everything was just wonderfull. The meat was cooked perfectly, the stew sauce was amazing, and the mac n cheese is heavenly (probably my fav dish here, would eat it everyday if I could :-)). Some might say that the portions are a little small, I think they are perfect, fills you up perfectly without leaving you too stuffed & I find the prices amazing too for the quality & the presentation of food they serve. Yes we'll be back very soon!!",positive
ch609,11/5/2013,revch1708,5,"Wow!  What a nice surprise.  I'd been by this place numerous times, and it doesn't look like much from the outside (especially considering the two places it's sandwiched between).  But my wife and I were looking for something new to try, so we stopped in for dinner.

We noticed it was very busy on a random Tuesday evening - probably a good sign.  We also noticed everybody was genuinely friendly inside: the host, our waiter, the manager.... The decor was nice too.

And the food was outstanding.  I started with the butternut squash soup, which I usually am not a fan of but the server really sold it on us.  I was not disappointed at all - it was delicious.  Garnished with duck ravioli and full of flavor.  For my entree I had the scallops.  Again, lots of flavor, served over mashed potatoes and topped with fresh sprouts.  Delicious, and not overly filling either.  My wife really enjoyed her natural roasted chicken and wine.  With our entrees being so good, we took home some bread pudding for dessert.  

Overall, very pleasantly surprised.  We'd intended to grab a quick bite, but this turned into an outstanding meal.  We will definitely return.  (And it takes a lot for me to give five stars!)....",positive
ch609,11/1/2013,revch1709,5,"This place was AMAZING! I had the salmon, and the chef cooked it EXACTLY how I'd wanted it..after he personally came to our table and asked what exactly I'd meant by ""slightly charred""...it was perfect.  My boyfriend had the lamb, and that was delightful too. The pistachio ice cream is definitely a must-try - you can tell its not that artificial junk with food dyes in it. They make the ice cream in house, and it's all natural, amazing deliciousness. The service was excellent as well; from the hostess to the waiters to the chef himself (Mike), this is definitely a restaurant to check out. I will most definitely be back to visit! If I could give it more stars I would.",positive

ch609,10/15/2013,revch1713,4,"I have to say this did not disappoint.  Both out of town buddy and I were very impressed by the service, the presentation and the taste.  I had the salmon that was pretty darn good. But when you ask if the salmon is wild and the server says uhh, well it's sustainable.  Yeah. That means farmed. I don't care if it's from Scotland, it's farmed , and at this time of year get fresh northwest or Alaskan salmon from the pacific.  Wild. I get it at Fry's .  I would certainly recommend to others.  Not very busy but food  out quickly and hot.  Give it a try if you're in Scottsdale     I will be back for sure. Again staff was great and attentive.  If you want to walk out stuffed go to a dump like red lobster. Support local restaurants   My bro said his salad and scallops were great  so really I would make it a 4.5 if I could",positive

Great atmosphere as well. Cool decor.",positive
ch609,10/14/2013,revch1715,5,Stumbled upon this place and glad we did! Tried the schreiner's sausage and pork belly with grits it was yummy and so were the beef medallions. Nice wine list too,positive
ch609,10/12/2013,revch1716,4,"We really enjoyed our meals here. Almost everything was great. The place is super cute inside and is much bigger than it appears when you walk in.

We started with the mussels appetizer which blew me away. This is the first place that I have been to in Arizona that can actually make decent mussels and these weren't just decent - they were awesome! For the entrees we tried the lamb and the scallops. Both were great. The only comment I can make is that the lamb was out of this world, but the scallops were just ""solid."" Also, the cream of mushroom soup was pretty bland so that is the only thing I would recommend skipping. 

This is truly a great neighborhood place and I can't believe I waited so long to try it. I will be back soon!",positive
ch609,10/10/2013,revch1717,4,"I would've given this place 5 stars if they did not forget about my husbands entree.  But he did truly try to make it up to us, so we're happy with that. I just didn't like that his reason wasn't truthful.  Hubs ordered the lamb, I ordered the NY Strip, son ordered the cheese pizza.  We started off with the Schreiner sausage and Pork Belly with polenta appetizer.  It was amazing.  The glaze and apples on the pork belly gave it such a flavorful twist.  I loved every bite.  My entree and my sons came out shortly after that.  We were told that hubs meal was on his way.  A couple moments later, the server came back and asked what the hubs ordered, to which he replied, the lamb.  Okay, so this clearly meant he forgot to put my hubs order in, right?  Why would he come back to ask again what he ordered?  For the next 25 minutes, the server came out about 5 times to let us know that his dish would be out shortly.  The server comp'd a beer for him for his patience.  Came out later and said the Chef messed up his lamb the first time and was trying to perfect it for him the 2nd time and that's why it's taking so long - this is when I knew it was a lie because if that were the case, he should've told us that instead of coming out and asking what he ordered.  Finally when I was practically done with my meal, his lamb came out.  Hubs said he was so hungry that even if the lamb was not good, he would still think it was great.  Our server also comp'd us dessert for the trouble (and because we were celebrating our anniversary) - which was a warm chocolate bread pudding with vanilla sauce and berries.  We gobbled that thing up - it was incredibly tasty - warm, moist and flavorful.  Tommy, the server, definitely was great, he was attentive and friendly - it just made me irritated that he just couldn't be honest in saying that he forgot to put our order in instead of saying the Chef messed up.  We would've been fine either way.  

We'll definitely come back to this place.  But yes, I gave it 1 less star for lack of honesty even though we had good service and great food.

Oh, and there was bread?  We weren't offered any...",positive
ch609,10/2/2013,revch1718,5,"We've enjoyed Rusconi's by ourselves, with friends and with a group.  Always fun and always fabulous food.  The staff is great the food is yummy with wonderful presentation, there are always a few ""ooh and aahs"" when we get our plates.",positive
ch609,10/1/2013,revch1719,5,"I chose this restaurant based on YELP reviews and also because it was a choice on Arizona Restaurant Week.  

Arrived with a group of 4 people and a baby.  3 of us ordered off the restaurant week menu. I chose the shrimp appetizer (pan roasted gulf shrimp), Australian Sea Bass with roasted fingerling potatoes, and the Panna Cotta Passionfruit dessert. 

I have to get all my food modified to be made without butter, cheese or milk and still it was all incredible tasting. The Panna cotta was gluten and dairy free. Everyone enjoyed their meal and all 4 of us agreed that we would all love to come back here for another meal.",positive
ch609,9/28/2013,revch1720,4,"I like this place despite its location in a strip mall. The food is really quite good and the drink list even better. It had a good atmosphere and our service was very good. We had a server that was a bit eccentric, yet very friendly and knowledgable.  He had us laughing and awaiting his return because he was so entertaining.",positive
ch609,9/28/2013,revch1721,5,Food was excellent! I had short ribs entree and shrimp palenta appetizer! Both far exceeded my expectations. I will be going back to eat here soon!,positive
ch609,9/26/2013,revch1722,5,"Rusconi's American Kitchen is in a plaza stuck between a Panda Express and Corleones.... That's like putting a Porsche between a Ford Escort and a Dodge Neon. There's nothing wrong with either of those cars but... they're just not at the same level. 

The thing I like most about Rusconi's is that it has a hip, urban, modern vibe without being pretentious. 

We came in on this day to check out the Restaurant Week offerings. Our server John, a really cool, friendly guy got us our drinks and we were off to the races.

I started with the Pan Roasted Gulf Shrimp and Yellow Polenta. Perfectly cooked shrimp, corn, bacon, delicious polenta. Score! 

My main course was the Braised Beef Short Ribs with Roasted Garlic and Herb Spaetzle. I don't even know what a spaetzle is, but this dish was divine. The braised rib was melt in your mouth tender... and it was meat, which I love. The sherry jus that it's bedded in is so good too, great flavor. Everything worked together nicely.

Finally, my favorite part of any meal. Dessert. I went with the White Chocolate Budino. Yup, I have no idea what a budino is either, but again... home run. It tasted like a fancy pudding but with more consistency than pudding. Then there's the caramel and pecans which add to the texture and sweet goodness.

Side note: The Chocolate Bread Pudding was awesome too, even though I only got one bite... 

Best Meal I've had in Phoenix to date. The service was on point from beginning to end as well. Each course was well timed (an art) and our glasses were always full. 

If you haven't been here, I highly recommend this unassuming gem. Now excuse me while I go Google Spaetzle and Budino.",positive
ch609,9/22/2013,revch1723,5,"Lured in by the fixed price Restaurant Week menu, we enjoyed a surprisingly fantastic dinner here.  Located in a busy strip mall, we were skeptical as we approached but were immediately set at ease after we walked in. The interior is very upscale with an open kitchen, sit down bar, and is larger inside than what it appeared from the parking lot.  We each tried one of the three appetizers, entrees, and deserts that were featured and were not disappointed with anything (nor was there a morsel left on any of the plates!)  We were able to try the mushroom soup (could have used a little more salt and a fresh herb garnish), corn polenta with shrimp, and roasted beet salad along with the braised short ribs, fresh sea bass, and beef tenderloin medallions with goat cheese polenta.  The wines suggested to go with the entrees were perfect, wait staff was excellent, and ambiance superb.  We will definitely be going back again!",positive
ch609,9/15/2013,revch1724,5,"I have to say that the dinner we had last night at Rusconi's was by far the best I have had in years.
John the server was very attentive, not at all rushy and very knowledgeable.

Head Office had the Salmon and I had the Sea Bass, which was the best I've had, even including one I had in Chile!

Service was impeccable, the ambience ideal and the wine list was adequate. 
For Dessert we shared a peach pudding which was made for the day fresh. It was delicious.

Very nice restaurant and we will definitely be back.",positive

This place was an unexpected find!  Very well prepared food that tasted fresh and perfectly seasoned. When I asked a question about the wines, I received a very well-informed answer.

ch609,7/27/2013,revch1730,5,"This restaurant is just what we needed in Paradise Valley!!  We first ate here July 25th, 2013 & we had a great time & enjoyed the camaraderie with the staff & among the patrons as well.  It's a lively place but not a nightclub.  There is ample bar area seating with a flatscreen TV (where we chose to eat) & the restaurant is larger than appears from the outside.  The kitchen is clean & very organized (& it was humming on this particular night) which is certainly a plus as it is open & visible from most tables.  The menu consists of delectables such as cream of asparagus soup, creative salads & top-notch gourmet entrees (Osso Bucco, Beef Tenderloin, Salmon & a hearty burger).  The bartender also has skills - cocktails range from the classics to the more trendy & there's a lot of them - specialties are written on a chalkboard just behind the bar & are solid & original.  On the particular night we dined (a Thursday night), the place was packed & it appeared they may not have been ready for the onslaught - the staff was thinly stretched but handled the chaos with aplomb.  Our entrees took a little bit longer than expected but we enjoyed ourselves during the wait because of the happy atmosphere with its slightly-rugged decor & delicious aromas wafting about.  The wine list is more than satisfactory & they have an extensive list of top-notch brands for any discernible palate.  Rusconi's will definitely be our go-to place in the neighborhood - with their great gourmet menu & casual vibe, who wouldn't love this place?!  The only thing that would make it better would be some good jazz (like Mindy Abair, Dave Koz or Euge Groove) piped in over a speaker or two - but maybe with all the energetic banter going on in the place, you might not hear it.",positive

From salads to entrees to desserts we have enjoyed everything we have tried. The servers are knowledgeable about the wine list. The cocktails are typically well poured. Every time we have been to Rusconi's, Michael has visited our table, taken time to talk with us, and made suggestions. It is not a cheap night out but don't' think the prices are unreasonable given the quality of the food and the level of service. It is definitely worth the splurge!",positive

My husband and I tried the restaurant on several occasions. We want a non-chain restaurant to succeed in this location. We've experienced lapses in service and the food has been unmemorable. A particular visit particularly stands out. We brought our family to Rusconi's for lunch. The bartender acted very disinterested. We sat for 15 minutes without being offered water or drinks. When he did bring our food order, the food must have been sitting for awhile. The fries with the burgers were cold, the bartender/waiter had mixed up two of the orders, and then there was the posole. The posole resembled dirty dishwater. There was literally one piece of posole floating in the broth. When we asked our waiter to split the checks, he sighed and said it was a ""big deal"" for him to do so. Needless to say, we won't be back nor will any members of our party.",negative

ch609,6/10/2013,revch1742,5,"This restaurant really is improperly named.  The one reviewer that speaks about the food being sold out, does need to understand, this is a gourmet chef, using fresh products each day, and so this is not your standard fare, and when they are sold out, they really bend over backwards to accommodate you.  Chef Rusconi generally will come out to meet with the people.
The first time I found this restaurant, it was because my friend told me she had found this wonderful restaurant I had to try.  What an understatement!
We had the goat cheese and artichoke dip with soft pita bread, and braised ribs over a white truffle and mashed potato blend, with a golden brown gravy.  For dinner, one friend had the N.Y. Strip with the White truffle mac & cheese.  Another friend had the roasted Rack of Lamb.  I decided upon the scallops which were perfectly washed, not a bit of sand, and carmelized perfectly, plump and tender.  Not overcooked as so many restaurants do.

Good atmosphere though.",negative
ch609,5/30/2013,revch1746,3,"I am reviewing this restaurant based on what it's aiming to be: a highish-end foodie destination.  I'm always nervous to try out new places at this price point, so whenever we are lucky enough to get a dinner out on our employers' dime, I get a little more willing to experiment outside my tried and true options.  Like many others that have reviewed this restaurant I was excited to have this addition to our neighborhood, however this place was a big disappointment.  Ambience and servers were nice, which is keeping this place from coming in at 2 stars.  Our waiter suggested a bottle of wine that I didn't like much at all, drinkable but not at all memorable.  

We started with the charcuterie plate and the truffled mac & cheese (at our waiter's recommendation).  I get much better charcuterie at a place like Windsor and I found the mac & cheese to be plain gross.  In fact, I think most everyone at our table didn't like it as we didn't even finish the small little dish that was served (but as I said it was a business dinner so no one said much out loud).   

The salad course was the best part of dinner- I thought my arugula, beets, goat cheese (ordinary) with fennel and mango (inventive!) was extremely tasty.  Others at the table appeared to like their salads as well. 

I ordered the scallops at the server's recommendation.  The scallops themselves were the best thing on the plate (nicely cooked, perfectly salted), but nothing else on the plate was very good.  The spaetzle tasted like plain noodles, and there was some spicy red sauce drizzled around the plate that could have been Sriracha sauce (and yes, there is a time and place where Sriracha sauce is a delicious addition, but this was not it).  No one else at the table said much about their entrees positive or negative (which included Osso Bucco and the Buffalo).

Finally, desserts were boring.  Maybe we should have ordered the house made ice cream, but we opted for the bread pudding (which they were out of) and the creme brulee.  We got a pot of some other type of pudding/mousse instead.  They were fine. 

Perhaps my expectations were too high, but I was just disappointed all around.",negative
ch609,5/25/2013,revch1747,5,"Great diner The other night.  Our second time in a week. Loved the restaurant week menu the other night  they have half price wine nights on Sunday and monday nights. We also Loved the new Cocktail menu.  The grilld pear Martini is the best I ever had.  Had the new Seabass, a lighter spring type dish, the fish was very fresh and cooked perfectly.  Loved the Quinoa with it, you don't see that very often.  My friend had the Rack of Lamb which he said was the best he ever had Mild Curry and Apricot crust was great. She was worried about the Curry but it was very mild and went well with the apricots.  The bread pudding is also new since our last time and we loved it.  This is our 5th time back and it just keeps getting better.",positive
ch609,5/25/2013,revch1748,5,"It's difficult to find an American restaurant anymore where you are expected to trust the chef.  It's usually pick an entree and pick a side.  Rusconi's is one of those establishments where the chef does not just craft each dish; Rusconi actually pairs the entree with the sides.  This is refreshing.

Take, for example, the first meal I had there: the pork osso buco.  It is served with prickly pear-braised red cabbage, grilled asparagus, and garlic mashed potatoes.  If you don't like those sides, you don't deserve to eat the pork osso buco.  That's really all there is to it.

That may sound harsh, but that is how art should be. (To be fair, I don't know if Rusconi does substitutions.  I was never churlish enough to ask.)

I have also had the Durham Ranch Buffalo Sirloin and the Rack of Lamb.  Both were cooked perfectly.

One thing I should note about this place is it's not for the person who wants to leave stuffed.  The portions are not huge, but they are satisfying.  This is how restaurants should be; overeating is one of the biggest public health issues we face as a society.  Thank you Chef Rusconi for doing your part to fix this.  I love that I can still go for a run after eating dinner here.",positive

I highly recommend the Kitchen Burger and fries, which for around $10 is the best sit down lunch around these parts.",positive
ch609,4/21/2013,revch1751,4,"Even though I love the food here, I'm a little concerned that this place isn't going to make it.  The food is outstanding, but I think there is something wrong with management.  I was here on a recent Friday for happy hour, and while my bartender was attentive and very nice to me, he tossed a tip in another bartender's face (in front of customers) and called him some choice names.  It was awkward to say the least.  Also, even though the place was relatively empty (except for the bar area) my salad and other dishes took quite some time to come to the table.  My one other negative observation would be that management does not seem to be aware of what kind of alcohol they have available.  I was going to order a delicious cocktail that used Hendrick's gin (which nobody ever seems to have).  When I ordered the drink and complimented the bartender for their gin selection, the bartender looked really confused.  He told me they didn't have Hendrick's.  He wanted to sub it for Bombay, but Hendrick's is a unique Scottish gin, infused with rose and cucumber, so Bombay wouldn't have suited the cocktail.  He made me something else that was great, but when we were looking at the cocktail menu, we found another drink that required a brand of alcohol that they didn't have.  While all of these individual events aren't extremely unusual (coworkers fight, menus get screwed up), seeing them all in one visit is usually a sign that the manager isn't on top of it (especially allowing a bartender to have a dispute with a coworker in front of customers).  In any case, the back-of-the-house seems to have it together because the food is exceptional.  It's like eating comfort food, only better.  It's one of the few places I've eaten at that does grits well.  The roasted chicken salad with strawberries sounds really simple and it is, but it's extremely flavorful.  The sliders are great as well.  I've never had a bad dish here (the Kitchen Platter appetizer isn't bad, but it's definitely average--it's the only thing I would skip).  I think everything is priced as it should be, considering the quality and portions, EXCEPT for dessert.  The portions are pretty darn small considering the cost.  I would definitely visit them during happy hour and stay for dinner.  I hope they are able to overcome their staffing and menu hiccups so they can be around for a long time!  This neighborhood could use some quality restaurants that aren't chains.",positive
ch609,4/13/2013,revch1752,4,"Yum, yum, and more yum! We ate outside on a lovely evening. Started off with the pork belly (not to be missed) and the artichoke/goat cheese dip. Great starters! There we three of us: my husband had the skirt steak with to-die-for truffle mac n cheese, I had the pork osso bucco, our friend had the ""Kitchen"" burger. Note: Skip the burger and go for the other stuff. 
Ignore the fact that their wood door makes the place look like it's closed and under construction (and the hostesses will tell you that they hear that multiple times every night). Once you get inside, the decor is hip and comfortable. 
We will definitely be back! (I'd give it 5 stars if it wasn't for the burger and the door!)",positive
ch609,4/9/2013,revch1753,5,"Went here for our wedding anniversary and LOVED it. At first when we pulled into the strip mall, I thought, ""Hm..."" but it was really wonderful. The decor is charming and very well thought out. The design features an open kitchen, which we were seated near, but we never had a problem with too much noise. Our server welcomed us with a ""Happy Anniversary"" and was exceptionally attentive. The chef, who's from Chicago, stopped by the booth and talked with us for several minutes. The food (I had the Scottish salmon; my husband, the sea bass) was delicious. They've only been open about seven months but were decently busy for a Monday night.

The menu is not large but it IS varied - everything from Buffalo Sirloin to rack of lamb, scallops, etc. And the wine list is similarly not broad but excellent. 

Our server said that on Friday and Saturday nights it's best to make a reservation; we had one for Monday but probably didn't need it. 

Highly recommend and if we lived in Phoenix we'd definitely go back often. As it is, we're in Georgia and will have to rely on our AZ friends to help keep Rusconi's open. Check it out - you won't be disappointed!",positive
ch609,4/8/2013,revch1754,2,"Had a very mediocre experience here. I was really excited to try due to it's proximity to my parent's house. I was thinking it would be a good place for us to frequent. The food was nothing special, my order was wrong, and the service sporadic. Won't be back.",negative

ch609,3/30/2013,revch1756,5,"I rarely give places 5 stars but I honestly cannot think of anything bad about this place. We had a reservation but they sat us immediately. The waiter was very attentive, the head chef was expediting orders on a Monday night which I was impressed with, and the food was great.

I had the pork osso bucco and my wife had the paella; we also had the short rib appetizer. Everything was amazingly done. Also, for dessert my wife coconut panna cotta with diced mango for dinner... again, another amazing meal.

I would highly recommend this place.",positive

During our stay we had Sunday brunch and a weekday dinner at the excellent Rusconi's American Kitchen. The food is absolutely delicious.  I believe my statement as I ate was, ""this is to die for."" The decor and ambiance are inviting and warm. Chef Michael puts his heart, soul and culinary genius into every scrumptious dish. The staff is professional and attentive. Whether you live in the greater Phoenix area or are just visiting, this restaurant is well worth the trip to Shea and Tatum. Just writing this review is making my mouth water.",positive
ch609,3/4/2013,revch1760,5,Loved it. This was our second time and we will be back again. Their truffle mac n cheese is delish!,positive
ch609,3/3/2013,revch1761,4,We came for a birthday also and although they aren't set up for that sort of thing they brought out a treat just before the check which was very cool. The menu is unique and we all had great meals but one of the particular people in our group needed to have tartar with her salmon so she snagged the first guy to walk by and it turned out to be the owner and chef who said without hesitation he would make her some. It was like gourmet tartar sauce. There was some other special request by Ms. Particular so she went to thank him after and he came over to the table and chatted. The place is awesome and great for a special occasion or an upscale lunch.,positive

Had the NY Strip Steak w White Truffle Mac & Cheese and my wife had the Grilled Salmon Blackberry Glazed which both were well prepared.

Service was prompt and always met our needs, would have rather sat toward the back then against the front window.

Restaurant has good ambiance and is decorated nicely considering it is in a strip mall.

Was one of the more enjoyable meals that I have had for sometime.",positive

I also enjoyed the grey hound they had on the drink menu as well.  All in all, I can't wait to go back.  I just may need to go 2 times in one week!  No, no, I'll wait a week and go back.  That way I can build up the anticipation again!",positive
ch609,2/2/2013,revch1765,5,"AMAZING Scallop dish!  All three of our dinners were great.  We had a hard time ranking the other two, but Scallops were wonderful.  Servers were wonderful.  We sat at the community table and watched the kitchen.  They were amazing as they worked in harmony!!  Highly recommend this restaurant.  I also recommend reservations!",positive
ch609,2/1/2013,revch1766,2,"I soo wanted to love this place. It sounded just right. Space is fine, vibe is very nice, decor restful, staff polite ... But:

1. I came specifically for the Osso Boco, I was there 15 minutes after start time , at 5:15 pm, & I was told they're out of it & can't make any more for at least 1 hr or 1 1/2 hrs. Say what?
2.  After 25 minutes I called the waiter over & asked if we could perhaps have some bread:
""Oh, you want bread? We don't serve it unless you ask. ""  Say what??
10 minutes later 2 slices of stale over toasted French bread appeared. 
3. Scallops. 4 for $24. $6 a pop. Nice presentation, but totally over seasoned. Beautiful scallops turned into salt bombs!

& not a sign or hint of any gesture of trying to make it better, not have a glass of wine on the house, or how about some dessert on us,  nothing. Not even were sorry please give us another chance. 

Disappointed!",negative

ch609,1/21/2013,revch1769,5,"I came here for my birthday dinner last week with three other people and it was the perfect pick. We had a reservation and were sat right away in view of the kitchen, which was fun because we got to see all the action. 
All of the food looked incredible as it went by and it did not disappoint when we ordered! Two of my party got the steak (I forget which one) which came with the most delicious macaroni and cheese that I've probably ever had. My other friend got the salmon that she really enjoyed and I chose the pork osso bucco. I'm not really a pork person, but it looked SO good that I couldn't resist. Wow. Amazing. It fell right off the bone and was perfectly paired with the prickly pear cabbage. Needless to say, we did a good amount of eating off each other's plates and they were clean by the end of the night. 
Dessert was pretty good. The panna cotta was light and refreshing and the empanadas hit our fried sweet spot. Service was excellent and the decor was beautiful. I can't wait to go back!!",positive
ch609,1/21/2013,revch1770,5,Food was good. Service was excellent. Decor was very nice. An all around plus for me. A little pricey for lunch but the service was so good that I was okay with it. Will be back :),positive
ch609,1/20/2013,revch1771,5,"Hmm, I wrote a review earlier and now can't find it.   Three of us had brunch here today and, again, it was wonderful.   The Kitchen Eggs Benedict was light, beautifully executed and just perfect.",positive
ch609,1/15/2013,revch1772,4,"I normally would not hesitate to give a place two or one stars for very bad service problems since I was a certified restaurant trainer for some time. 

The dark haired youthful looking line cook made up for all the problems we had and went beyond all jobs he had to do and was a saving grace and deserves to be recognized and made our visit worth going back for. I DO NOTE the waitress wasn't at any fault at all since she was clearly over loaded with responsibilities including seating people while she was over loaded.

To keep it as short as possible. We ordered, drinks that almost didn't come out Meals were run out  while after sitting under heat lamp by line cook one meal came out one undercooked so we had to run one back to kitchen, and the LINE COOK ran the meal to me. I am touched and I need to say in general the food in the end was very solid.

The dinner items seem to have a little more Wow factor but what we had was good and better than what you get at most places.

I hope they get space heaters for next winter because it was a chilly maybe 43 degrees in the dining room just like outside was on Sunday.",positive
ch609,1/13/2013,revch1773,5,"I was here for lunch one day in the middle of the week, got seated quickly and loved the atmosphere. I'm vegetarian and they accommodated me quite well. I opted for the  roasted turkey panini but sans turkey. The waitress offered to see if the chef could instead sub zucchini and  yellow squash. It was very delicious and the side salad had a yummy vinaigrette. Overall great service, glad to see this type of restaurant in a crowded area with limited fine dining selections.",positive
ch609,1/12/2013,revch1774,5,"Everything I love and nothing I don't. Nice atmosphere -- cozy yet modern, very friendly. We got there a little early and sat at the bar. Nice selection of craft brews. San Tan Hop Shock IPA was wonderful. We started dinner with a (shared) bowl of the soup of the day; a delicious squash soup with duck confit. Oh, yes. My pork osso bucco was fall-off-the-bone-tender, the pickled cabbage and asparagus spears were a great complement, and they let me sub in corn spaetzle for the standard garlic mashed potatoes. Wifey enjoyed her squash ravioli, and our 4 friends loved their scallop and steak dishes. Shared two small plate desserts - a chocolate creme brulee and berry empanadas. Really good. Service was friendly and attentive. A perfect evening.",positive

ch609,12/6/2012,revch1781,4,"What a nice addition to this area of town! You don't necessarily expect to find an eating establishment of such high quality in a shopping complex. Rusconi's is nestled between a Panda Express & My Big Fat Greek. With the lack of street visibility, you just might just overlook this gem - look for the huge wooden entry door (which almost gives the appearance that the place is boarded up if you are just driving by). 
One step inside, and you know right away that this is no ordinary strip mall eatery. Very inviting décor, and beautifully decorated with and upscale feel, but not pretentious. 

We didn't have a reservation - this was a weeknight and the place was busy! A couple of seats opened up at the bar so we opted for them instead of waiting. The bartenders greeted us right away and introduced themselves (Dave, Zack and ""the new guy"")  and started us off with our adult libations. 

We skipped the starters and dove right into the entrees: Roasted Natural Chicken and Grilled Salmon. The salmon, with a wonderful blackberry glaze, was grilled to perfection. And delicious, too! When the chicken dish was delivered, I was told that the plate was very hot. And it was - at least half of it. And the food itself was lukewarm - tasty, but disappointing. I mentioned this fact and my dish was whisked away to be made right. When the next one was delivered, it was piping hot...and oh, so good! Chef Michael Rusconi's green chili mac 'n cheese is wonderful! The chili does not overpower the dish so you get a wonderful layering of flavors. The chicken was very moist and super-flavorful.

This is going to be one of our ""go-to"" places! Great ambience, delicious food, reasonable prices - what more can you ask for?",positive
ch609,12/6/2012,revch1782,4,"New to Yelp, just moved back to the Phoenix area after living in CA for a few years. I went to Rusconi's today for lunch after reading about it and Chef Rusconi's history in the valley. The restaurant was very nice and clean, appealing to the eye and very warm and comfortable. The server explained to us that the chef had done all of the interior wood work himself. Great job! Service was good, menu was nice and simple and my burger and salad was great. $9 for a great burger and house salad.......good price for an upscale and comfortable dining experience. I'll definitely be back.",positive

The owner/chef has worked at fabulous restaruants here in the valley.  I think part of the staff needs to be trained a little more.  But I have had servers there that were also amazing and very professional.  They have a cute little fire place you can sit near and is great when the weather is cold. I can't wait until they open up for brunch. BRAVO Mr. Rusconi.,positive
ch609,11/6/2012,revch1788,5,"This particular day I was having one of the worst days in a long time.  I wasn't feeling well and I wanted to relax and have dinner with my mom.  So we were in the area of Tatum and Cactus and I decided to Yelp something from my phone.  I discover this fine little establishment with what looked to be a spectacular menu.  I thought, ""If they can pull this off, I am in.""  Pull it off they did, indeed.  Not only did they turn my whole day around, but I discovered a fantastic new restaurant. 

We walk in, they place has only been open a few weeks, we were promptly greeted with warm inviting smiles and everyone was extremely friendly.  The build out of the restaurant was really nice and I was excited to sample the menu.  The only problem I could see, was that I could not possibly eat every dish.  

I chose the Boneless Short Ribs, which came out so tender and moist and delicious, I was in heaven.  It was accompanies with a Sweet Potato mash, that was 'vanilla scented' according to the menu.  The short ribs had ancho chili chocolate sauce on top, just a light glaze that really brought out the flavor in the short ribs.  The entire meal was delightful with great service and great wine. 

My mom chose to have the the Butternut Squash filled ravioli which has a delightful sauce over them and resting on a baby spinach bed.  They were fresh made, I think they make everything there.  These were awesome!  The fulling was not sweet, it tasted like they did nothing but puree the squash, simple, elegant and perfect as it is.  

Apparently Rusconi's uses local produce for their menu and that insures freshness of each dish they provide.  I would definitely recommend dining here.  I saw they even had a nice happy hour menu also, available at the bar only. My next stop will be happy hour for sure. Keep up the good food and service!",positive
ch609,11/3/2012,revch1789,5,Went there for lunch today with some coworkers.  The GM and Chef both stopped by our table to greet and thank us for coming in!  Great service and even better food.  I can't wait to go back and try this place for dinner.,positive
ch609,11/3/2012,revch1790,5,"I can't say enough good things about Rusconi's! We were excited to see a new local place opening in our neighborhood. We are now there at least once a week and my husband goes for happy hour 2-3 times per week. We normally sit at the bar, watch sports, and chat. The drinks are great and Dave and Zack treat us phenomenal! We have only sat in the dining room once but had a great experience there as well. We like it so much we have brought many of our friends in.

The food is Amazing!! I absolutely LOVE the veggie flatbread and order it almost every time I go. I even add the sausage sometimes.  The great thing about it is that it always seems different but tastes great. I love that it is grilled.  A+ flatbread

The Mac & Cheese is out of this world. So delicious! You can't go wrong here.

The Pork Belly is one of my husband's personal favorites as well. So much flavor packed into this dish.

We have had many other dishes that have all been tasty and can't wait to try more.
We have really enjoyed Rusconi's thus far and look forward to having dinner and hanging out there more.",positive
ch609,10/28/2012,revch1791,5,"We were in town last weekeend and made a reservation for Sunday night. When we got there we were  greeted warmly and professionaly. The hostess chatted us up while taking us to our table, personalizing the experience. Our sever came over quickly and started to explain some of the menu items . After receiving our beverages, we ordered our meal. We got the pork belly app, and flat bread pizza, braised short ribs and the butternut squash raviolis'. It's evident Rusconi's use fresh ingredients and home made techniques. The pork belly was tender and melted in my mouth. The flat bread was crispy but not overcooked. It was topped with fresh tomato's and mozzarella. The butternut squash ravioli's come as 3 large home made ravioli's with a corn jus. The short ribs were braised perfectly and were served with a knife which I just put to the side because it wasn't needed. The were so tender and flavorful. Do yourself a favor and don't pass up Rusconi's Kitchen. There's no other restaurant like it near by. There's plenty of restaurants near by but none of the quality of Rusconi's. So if your in North Phoenix make it a priority to get there.",positive

I loved the coconut panna cotta for dessert. It was very light and the server said it had not dairy or flour.\, not sure how they do that but it was really nice.  Wife had the Rack of Lamb Special.  If you get the chance have that because it was one of the best we have had.  This restaurant has only been open for 3 weeks now and it looks to be getting better already",positive

ch609,10/13/2012,revch1798,5,"We just had our first dinner at Rusconi's American kitchen.  

The hostess looked a little sideways when we didn't have a reservation (early on a Saturday night) but greeted us warmly and offered to ""squeeze"" us in.  We got it when we left and realized that the place was packed with lots of people waiting who probably all had reservations. 

I had a very hard time choosing an entree because I wanted several of them.  I settled on the rack of lamb with spinach and goat cheese gnocci.  The lamb was encrusted with something and cooked to perfection as was the spinach.  My husband really enjoyed the butternut squash ravioli and my daughter devoured a flatbread pizza.  If you go, the berry empanada dessert  was amazing.  Next time we'll order two rather than one to share three ways.

The service was exceptional, the atmosphere inviting and cool without a hint of pretentiousness.   This is a great addition to the neighborhood.  

We will be back.

PS... I commented that this was good for kids.  I should clarify that this was fine for my kid.  She's 11 and never has issues with fine dining or finding something she wants on the menu.  There were the flatbreads (like pizza) and a mac&cheese on the menu.",positive

I thought they had a nice selection of wine that were fairly priced.  Not only is the food amazing but the restaurant is beautiful!  You will not be disappointed.",positive
ch659,1/6/2015,revch1801,4,"1-6-15 My first visit.   I had a doctor's appointment nearby so I dropped in about 4:30PM.    First impression from outside..uh... mediocre.  Looks like any ol' bar.
The inside is entirely different.  It's just pretty.  Because of the time I went, it was nearly vacant so I headed to the bar to eat.

I wasn't sure what I wanted but I received menu, water, utensils, napkins, etc quickly and plenty of time to examine the menu, wine selection, beer selection etc and ask questions.  The server/bartender seemed genuinely nice as did what seemed to be a ""regular"" on the opposite side of the bar so we had a pleasant conversation before and during my meal.

I ordered the Lobster Bisque and Scallops with rice cakes.  The Lobster Bisque was good and as a friend told me, it was hot.  (We both have the pet peeve of ""warm"" food.)  It was moderately priced so I didn't expect or receive chunks of lobster but flavor was good... I would have loved just a drizzle of brandy on top... but not everyone likes it that way.

I really enjoyed the scallops.  It took me a while and and an explanation to figure out the ""rice cakes"" part.  The long, narrow dish contained a perfectly cooked scallop, then a rice cake, then a scallop, etc.  The rice cakes were actually similar to risotto balls.  The change in textures and flavors was a surprise but I liked it.  Seriously though, I haven't had such a perfectly cooked scallop in forever.  Good sear on outside that gave it a slightly smoked flavor and just barely, barely done.  

I agree with other reviewers that highest mark goes for ambiance.  Given it was nearly empty because of the hour and slow period after the holidays, I really want to check it out on a Friday or Saturday evening and see if they can keep up the friendly genuine service, quick service, and good food.

The menu was pretty big so I would expect some things to be not so good.  One patron recommended the fried gnocchi... but that seemed sacrilegious to me (and higher probability of being less than stellar)

I'm going to take a WAG and say the reviews about not so great food have to do with the larger than average menu.  Yes, I watch way too many cooking channel shows!!

None the less, I'm going back.  It's a beautiful restaurant and there's plenty of potentially delightful things on the menu so if they can execute consistently, it could new fav for me.",positive
ch659,1/5/2015,revch1802,4,"Delicious would be the most apt word to describe food at the ""The Sparklings"". We tried a bunch of appetizers and all of them were good. I would highly recommend the Crispy Gnocchi and Flatbread smeared with ricotta cheese.  The place has a very inviting and pleasing interior and the service is top notch. Also, ""The Sparklings"" is one of the few places that servers the Moscow Mule in a copper tumbler.  I would highly recommend the ""The Sparklings"".",positive
ch659,1/5/2015,revch1803,4,"What a diamond in the rough. You would not suspect the beauty of this dining room from the exterior. The velvet chairs, beautiful chandelier, and swanky atmosphere are lovely. 

The service was excellent. We got everything we needed without missing a beat. This was impressive with 3 toddlers in the group. 

Aside from a lovely room and great service, the food delightful and quite a value! Hubby and I shared clam chowder, scallops with crispy rice cakes and lemon buerre blanc, linguini and clams, and crispy gnocchi. We also got a side of fries and a beer. All for under $50! The gnocchi was creamy and delicious. A healthy portion for the $9 price. The scallops were good but nothing special. The sauce lacked the citrusy zing I was hoping for. Chowder was good with light airy crispy bread to dip. Linguini and clams was a winner. Flavorful and al dente. There was so much more I wanted to try! We will definitely go back. 

This would be a great place to entertain guests. Impressive and affordable.",positive
ch659,1/5/2015,revch1804,5,"We came here one night after ice skating, starving! And we were seated right away and the service was quick and efficient. 

We ordered the scallops as appetizers and they were served in less than 10 minutes. They were DELICIOUS! There were 6 of them, 3 of them being normal scallops but the other 3 had sweet rice in them; it was so different I loved them. 
Our meals arrived shortly after finishing the scallops. I ordered the Jambalaya and my friend ordered the spicy seafood pasta. They were both filling yet super flavorful. I loved them both. 

The Crème brûlée was just blissful. It was just perfect.

The ambiance was very comforting. They have couches and comfy chairs instead of normal chairs and I really liked how the restaurant was set up. Our server Tyler, was kind, quick, efficient and very helpful. 5/5, I will definitely be back and would definitely recommend this place to my friends!",positive

ch659,1/2/2015,revch1806,4,"A girlfriend and I tried this place for the first time together based upon recommendation. The ambience was nice and the furniture choice was good. I will say that this place is painfully quiet and the music is kind of odd. Definitely set some tones to our conversations. Get two girls in there and cocktails..well kinda makes us look bad. With that being said our waiter Tyler was very cute and nice. He was patient, service was great and put up with my jokes. The food was good..I don't know if I ordered the right things though. Calamari, sweet potatoes fries, and the pesto pasta. Fries were...fries but the sauces were good. Calamari...calamari. The pastas was good just very heavy. We also ordered some cocktails which were great. Anywhere with copper MM cups have won me over. All and all I think this place was good...change up the music and I think it will be even better!",positive
ch659,1/2/2015,revch1807,5,Such a great place! Had my birthday dinner here and was so pleasantly surprised by everything! Yummy food (lots of great seafood choices) and we had an awesome server - Jason is awesome! Totally made the night special! The atmosphere is relaxing and just all around wonderful. Will for sure be back!!,positive
ch659,12/30/2014,revch1808,2,"Beautiful venue, nothing amazing from the menus and service was so-so. Tried the meatballs which were a rave and I wasn't too fond. Everything was very average and the presentation was low key. Prices didn't reflect what the venue lacked. There are better places that deserve the rating this place has that are way better!",negative
ch659,12/28/2014,revch1809,4,"The Sparklings has some fantastic items in the appetizer section. 2 to 3 appetizers plus 1 entree would be perfect for two. Pricing doesn't look bad.

On our first visit, we ordered following three items. All good, I would have rated 5 stars for that visit.

- Seared Diver Scallops - served with crispy rice cakes and lemony beurre blanc $7.5 (5/5)
- Grapes and Arugula Flat Bread - candied walnuts, ricotta & balsamic vinaigrette $9 (4/5)
- Spicy Seafood Pasta - Spaghetti with shrimp, scallop, mussel, squid in house spicy light tomato sauce $15 (4.5/5)

On our second visit today, we ordered following five items. Hits and misses - mixed result. Not perfect, but less than $50 bill for 5 items is impressive.

- Crispy Gnocchi - creamy pesto, Italian sausage, peas and crushed candied walnuts $7.5 (4/5)
- Crab & Spinach Dip - grilled and fried pita bread $8 (3.5/5)
- Lobster Bisque - served with wonton crisps and green onions, sour cream optional $9 (2.5/5)
- Steak Salad - petite filet, spinach, red onion, feta cheese, apple and white vinaigrette $10 (3/5)
- Shrimp Po Boy Sandwich - shrimp tempura, remoulade, lettuce and tomato $8.5 (3/5)",positive
ch659,12/24/2014,revch1810,5,"We first went to this place earlier in the year, when it opened, and we loved it. I typically always get the steak salad, but have tried various other appetizers/entrees/desserts and they have all been so tasty!

I absolutely LOVE the decor in this restaurant as well as their outdoor space... so much so, that when my fiance and I were stressed out from trying to plan our wedding, we decided to have the restaurant host our reception! We worked with Andy and created a wonderful menu and experience for our wedding guests. He was very patient and understanding and just wanted to make sure we were happy. On the day of the reception, he was there for the majority of the time and made sure everything went smoothly. I really could not have had a better experience with Andy and his staff. Although I was nervous at first, since it's not a traditional wedding reception spot, I was pleasantly surprised and elated at the professionalism of everyone involved. Since it's still relatively new, I'd say about 99% of our guests had never been there and most of them raved to us about how good the food was, so I hope that they return on their own and continue keeping this place in business!

The cost for the reception was VERY reasonable and not inflated by the wedding industry. If it can handle a wedding reception, I would definitely recommend this restaurant for any private event.",positive
ch659,12/18/2014,revch1811,4,"The atmosphere was inviting and sophisticated. We were greeted by Jason and he truly was an entertaining and kind waiter. He brought a lively vibe to our dining experience and was eager to help us celebrate a big event for our group. He guided us through the menu with expertise and thoughtful descriptions that held true to taste. 
The drinks we enjoyed was 1)Amethyst 2) Emerald 3) Sparkling
They were each delicious but our favorite was the emerald. 
For the appetizer we enjoyed the scallops and the crispy gnocchi. Both were delightful and will be ordered again. 
For entrées we ordered the spicy seafood pasta, the clam linguini and the mushroom bacon cream sauce pasta with chicken. 
The spicy seafood pasta was indeed spicy but not overwhelmingly so. I am sensitive to very spicy things. 6/10 for spicy but it was very flavorful and will be ordered again. 
The clam linguini was Good but not spectacular as the other dishes. 
The mushroom bacon cream pasta was delicious.  

The most enjoyable item we ordered was the crispy gnocchi but the whole meal was a delight.",positive
ch659,12/17/2014,revch1812,3,"The Sparklings has a pretty high-end ambience for a restaurant in a strip mall. Lovely decor and the friendly staff are the highlights of this place. They offer some creative appetizers like bacon & dates wrapped meatballs and the crispy gnocchi. The name is a bit misleading because the gnocchi itself isn't crispy, but the dish is still good. The braised short rib came highly recommended but I found it way too salty. The flourless chocolate was surprisingly my favorite item to try. Most of the appetizers and entrees don't really spur any excitement for me but overall, The Sparklings is a nice place to spend happy hour or a quiet date night without breaking the bank.",negative
ch659,12/15/2014,revch1813,4,"The only thing stopping this place from being 5-star is the hideous looping elevator music soundtrack.
Sump-sump-sump. Wah-wah-wah-wah....
Moving on!
Food is spectacular, Service is awesome, the drink menu looked good, so did deserts. Price was fairly decent and they were serving late.
The bathroom is beautiful inside.
It's also a restaurant, and the booths can have the curtains drawn to make it all private. 
This is the kind of place where jeans and a t are somewhat out of place.
The whole vibe is upscale and beautiful, like the Cosmo.",positive
ch659,12/9/2014,revch1814,5,"Although this is not a gourmet restaurant, everything they served was a well-prepared and savory example of the item. We started with appetizers of meatballs wrapped in bacon and crunchy gnocchi, both delicious and unique. For entrees there was spaghetti with bacon served with chicken, a Philly cheesesteak sandwich and brie with turkey, again spot-on and flavorful. The location interior was a bit quirky, but in a compelling way-a cross between factory loft and grand ballroom. You'll see what I mean when you go inside. Server was attentive and friendly, owner came by to see about our experience, this restaurant is worth a try!",positive
ch659,12/7/2014,revch1815,5,"What a gorgeous find on the SW side of town!

My young daughter and I decided to try this place on a whim for dinner and loved it. The decor is very swanky, you will fall in love with the larger than life crystal chandelier hanging in the center of this beautiful dining room. You will adore the classy service. It has a quiet ambiance. 

The menu is fresh and interesting (in a good way), they do a great job of pairing drinks with menu items. They treated my daughter very well, she had the biggest smile on her face interacting with our waiter like a ""grown up"". That kindness and personal attention meant a lot to us. 

This would be a great venue for a family dinner, and very impressive for a special occasion. Highly recommend!",positive

ch659,11/23/2014,revch1818,3,"Great meal and very attentive service.  Menu seemed a little too all over the place.  The reason for the three stars really is the distance of the place, it's a $40 cab ride from the strip.  If you don't mind, worth the visit.",negative

When it comes to having visitors, needing to celebrate, happy hours, or just cause this is the place to go. Food and drinks are amazing as well as the service. It's rare to have all those things come together in one location! LOVE this place!",positive
ch659,11/22/2014,revch1820,4,"We came here based on yelp reviews and being that its close to the house!
I went here with my sister in law.
We brought our own bottle of wine, but the corkage is a little excessive at $30 so we ended up buying a bottle there for that same price.

Started with the scallops and my oh my they were delightful!!!! omg so effing good..we were excited about our entrees.
we both got the salmon and subbed the rice for mashed potatoes. So good!!

The only thing I have to say about the place and we did end up talking to the manager about this so I do hope they take it into consideration....(reason for the missing star)

The inside with the chandelier is as bright as the sun! not romanic at all.Music was very low and could hear the clanking of the silverware around as everyone is eating...and the low mumbling of conversations.

Ambience is so so important...and being that it's a big room...the lights need to be dimmed and music louder.period.otherwise it can be really awkward.
I dont care if people complain the lights are too dim and they can't read the menu...get your cellphone out and read it that way.

I would feel so awkward going on a date here with the brightness of the restaurant.
It's funny because the sign outside is so dim too...it needs to be switched around!

OK in summary it's a beautiful place and the food was delightful would recommend going!....
just take the lights down a notch! EASY FIX.

We will be back!

Oh yea and service was excellent!",positive
ch659,11/19/2014,revch1821,4,"First time I saw this place on yelp, I though wow this place has some great ratings. I've been here twice and I can say this place lived up to the hype. The prices on the menu are reasonable and actually on the lower side. I enjoyed the zucchini sticks and also the pulled pork sliders. I had a glass of scotch on the rocks during happy our and it was only around 6bux. The place can get a little awkward because it's just way to quiet. The lighting is a little bright. Make sure that you let your waiter know your gonna be splitting checks because the waiters don't really expect to do it. If your in a large groups make sure to let them know in advance. Other than that, great place for an odd location.",positive
ch659,11/13/2014,revch1822,2,"Honestly, I'm very surprised at how disappointing my experience was. We showed up around 6 on a weeknight and the place was pretty empty. Strangely, we weren't greeted by anyone when we came in, and we weren't sure if that meant we were supposed to wait or seat ourselves, so we waited and felt awkward about it. After about a minute and a half, one of the servers came out and noticed us standing there so he refilled someone's water and then showed us to our table.

The service was fine, no real complaints there. We ordered the Grapes, Arugula, and Ricotta Flatbread for the appetizer. For the entrees we ordered the Shrimp Po' Boy and the Chicken Parmigiana. The flatbread had great flavors, but it was seriously unwieldy. I admit that I can, at times, be coordinationally-challenged... but in my defense this was a piece of flatbread that had grapes and candied walnuts sitting on it, with no sharp knife to cut it into pieces. We ended up with a lot of sticky balsamic glaze on our hands, and I personally got a couple of grapes and walnuts in my lap and on the floor. So that was fun. 

Her Shrimp Po' Boy sandwich was good. Though in my opinion the small garnish salad on the side was a little measly looking. My Chicken Parmigiana was kind of crazy. The chicken itself was this massive flattened piece of chicken that covered almost the entire plate. I have never seen a piece of chicken like this, I wish I had taken a picture. Anyway, it was breaded and fried, and then set on top of a pile of watery, bland spaghetti. And I mean watery as in, when I tipped the bowl, about a quarter cup of water came forth. That was the water that hadn't already absorbed into the bottom of the chicken breading. It was soggy and strange and disappointing. The flavor of the chicken and breading was good, but I couldn't get over the sog factor. The pasta was unappetizing and I couldn't really eat much of it. 

The cocktails were nothing to write home about, especially for the price. I got something with ""fresh"" blueberries in it... and dared to eat one of them. It had no flavor, other than the taste of (possibly) freezer burn.. and the mealy texture that fruit sometimes gets. It was very gross.

The last thing I feel like mentioning just for the sake of being a complainer is that they were playing a collection of popular songs covered by someone on piano/violin. This included Sweet Child O' Mine by Guns N' Roses, and Unforgiven (I think?) by Metallica. Though there were no vocals in the recording, that didn't stop the guy at the table next to us from rocking out with his best Axl Rose impression. It made for an interesting ambiance, but it wasn't quite my cup o' tea.

Bottom line, I won't be back, and I won't be recommending it to anyone. I'm not much of a Yelp reviewer but this place has such amazing ratings I was left feeling confused by my experience and thought I should chime in.",negative
ch659,11/7/2014,revch1823,4,"My boyfriend and I went to The Sparklings tonight for dinner. We ordered the gnocchi and the caprese salad as our appetizer, delicious. I ordered the Jambalaya and he ordered the Ribs which were a special for the day. They were both nice and tasty. Our waiter Tyler was a doll. We were celebrating my bf birthday and they treated us to a free dessert. We are definitely making this our once a month date night place. Love love love the sparklings!!",positive
ch659,11/5/2014,revch1824,3,"""What lies behind us and what lies before us are tiny matters compared to what SPARKLES within us"" 
- Ralph Waldo Emerson (Paraphrased) 

The Sparklings boasts a unique and aesthetically pleasing interior, complete with a large chandelier that sparkles like a cheesy vampire in the sun. As others have noted, this interior is delightful, but also is one of the better things they have going. If the owners (also see Soyo and Oyshi) were hoping that The Sparklings would be the crown jewel to their south Rainbow eateries, they severely missed the mark here. The food looks great on the menu but doesn't shine in execution.  

If you find yourself sitting in The Sparklings and want to make the most of it try the Brown Butter Gnocchi or one of their seafood based pastas (Note: the Spicy Seafood Pasta was not very spicy.) You could also go with the Rice Au Gratin with Chicken or the Grapes Basil and Ricotta Flat Bread.  Then again, you could also go down the street 2,000 feet to Soyo for better food sans the delightful ambiance. 

It's not that the food is generally bad; it is simply average and not special in any way.  Happy Hour looks like the way to go as well if you're planning on coming in.

Do come here with a large group of people that don't appreciate elevated food. The setting would be wonderful for a group outing, adult birthday, or the like.",negative
ch659,11/5/2014,revch1825,3,"The ambiance and decor is STUNNING!! Reminds me of southern country chic. You could definitely host a large dinner party here. 

This is more like 3.5 stars because the food was just ok. I ordered the scallops appetizer and the bruschetta appetizer based on other reviews on yelp. The size of the scallop itself were so tiny!! Did not look like any of the pics on yelp. The crispy rice was way too hard so I just ate the scallops. The flavor and preparation was good though. The bruschetta was the best thing I tried although it was not memorable and something I probably won't crave for in the future. Also had the truffle fries and that was good too but nothing special. 

My friends had sandwiches which looked better than what I had. They both loved their meals. So maybe I will go back to try other dishes/apps and give an updated review.

Other than that prices are decent and decor and ambiance is amazing!",negative

We kept things simple with lunch with the club sandwich that was massive, had a couple of beers and the crispy gnocchi which was recommended by the waiter. All was super Delish and lucky me, I live a block away. Will definitely be coming back.

My husband went for pasta again but opted for the bacon cream sauce spaghetti this time. He loved every bite! Our friends ordered a chicken rice au gratin and a turkey cranberry sandwich!  The loved their choices as well and are lamenting the fact they can't eat here all the time. They even asked if we'd bring them here for every mesl until they leave! Thanks again Clayton for great service. Thank you kitchen staff and the chef for delivering such great food!,positive

It's a concise menu with a great choice in appetizers!  The decor is plush but inviting.  Now to the food!!! Good stuff! We both chose pasta meals and liked our meals. Great wine selection and plenty of beers plus a full bar! We'll have to try desert next time.",positive

The host greeted us and let us choose our table.  He was very attentive to us and a few other groups he was waiting on.

We got our menus and glasses of ice water and perused our menus.  We ordered a few appetizers; Parmesan Truffle fries and the Crispy Gnochhi.  My boyfriend ordered the Jambalaya and I ordered the braised short ribs.

The appetizers were yummy.  The gnocchi was really flavorful and the fries were crisp and topped with tons of Parmesan.

My boyfriend liked his Jambalaya, but it was a little salty.  My braised ribs were so tender the meat fell off the bones.  And the sauce was fantastic!

We ordered a bunch of appetizers and they all were great, the grilled wings were exceptionally delicious, the bacon wrapped date stuffed meatballs were perfect, our friend's father said his philly cheese steak was the best he'd ever had (and he's always on the hunt). We went back for lunch today and it was amazing, we sat on the patio, which was beautiful, and we ordered the wings again (our 3yr old loved them), the portobello fries, meatballs, calamari salad (delicious!) And this awesome turkey, brie, cranberry sandwich that was to die for! Not one thing has disappointed us and the service today was on point. This is my new favorite place to hang and eat! I believe they are kid friendly until late night. They had boosters and highchairs. Their beer and cocktail list is decent as well. Check this place out, it won't disappoint!",positive

Our bartender/waiter was very accommodating and he looks like a taller, cleanly shaven version of Iron Man lol!

The dining room was busy too so we grabbed a drink while we waited for a table to open up. It took about 10 minutes to get a drink, and by that time a table had opened up for us. Our server, Clayton, was super nice even though he seemed a bit frantic. 

We ordered crispy gnocchi, bacon-wrapped meatballs, spicy seafood pasta and the short ribs. Everything was fantastic, except the pasta was JUST OK. It was good, it just tasted like something I could easily make at home and there wasn't that much seafood in it. 

The ambiance is a bit strange. It's beautiful inside, but also kind of weird at the same time. The decor doesn't completely mesh, but somehow it's still cozy. I will say though, they should turn the music up a notch and dim the lights a notch as well. 

For our drinks, we ordered the bourbon mule, which I surprisingly liked even more than the vodka version, moscow mule. Clayton never left us hanging and checked on us JUST enough. At the end of the meal, our bill was about $75, which is not bad at all. We will definitely be coming back but we decided this is more of a hang out in the lounge and order a few drinks and food items from the apps list, not so much a romantic dinner type place.",positive

ch659,9/20/2014,revch1846,2,"By the look of the restaurant you think you are going to get a good meal but by the time we tasted our appetizer we knew the quality would not be there. 

We started off with the grapes, arugula and ricotta flat bread. The flat bread was barely warm which made it hard to eat because the ingredients kept rolling off. It was over dressed with balsamic vinaigrette and needed a drizzle instead of a pour. The ingredients in this dish had the ability to work well together but the dish just ended up tasting unsophisticated. For our mains we ordered the chicken Parmesan and the Philly cheesesteak. 

Once again, both dishes were unrefined. 

Chicken Parmesan-  dish was under seasoned, breading was soggy at the bottom and crispy on the top making me think the chicken was not freshly breaded,it was dry

Philly cheesesteak- the low quality of meat and bread was evident. It came with a spring salad that had no dressing and a pickle spear sitting on top. Even if you like pickles I don't think anyone wants it seeping into their salad. 

It's too bad that the food does not deliver because they did a great job on the theme.",negative

It seems like a nice place to come with a bunch of girls or bunch lol

What I didn't like is how hot it was in here. We do live in Las Vegas so you don't want to eat dinner and worry about if your sweating. It was so hot I has to step outside to cool down. 

I did like there happy hour 7-10pm. That was great. The food was alright, didn't really like the calamari because it was way toooo hard. The steak was way under cooked.

We also tried the crab dip and the lobster bruschetta and they were tasty but not the best. 

My husband has ordered the cajon chicken and shrimp pasta and he thought it was really good. He ordered the chicken parm before also and said it was average and would have preferred to get the pasta.

ch659,9/9/2014,revch1853,4,"""I'm not in the mood for a Crystal, Diamond, Amber, or Jade at Sapphire.  No, not my Destiny.""  I say to laughs from the guys and one ""you're a pig"" from the lone female in our group.

""You have to call me that because you're a girl"". I giggle.  ""Oooh, and I want food"".

""Fine"" she continues.  ""let's go to Sparklings"".

""Oooh Sparklings"". I coo, more laughter from the guys.

""It's not that kind of place... pig"" she concludes.

Contemporary meets country sheik.  With it's strong feminine vibe, it's the perfect place for a local, ladies night out.  Guys, you'll understand the appeal.

The food leans towards sensibly portioned Cali cuisine with just right amount of bad for the health to be Vegas.  The classic bacon wrapped dates becomes a delicious bacon wrapped meatball with dates.  No longer bite size, the ground meat a little dry in texture but the combination with the tomato sauce is very good.

Continuing with starters, a warm flatbread smeared with ricotta cheese and overloaded with arugula, halved seedless grapes, and candied walnuts then drizzled with a balsamic reduction is well executed.  A salad you can hold with the right contrast of sweetness to tangy cheese, crunch to tender, bitter greens.  The other standout is the crispy gnocchi served in a pea pure, creamed pesto with bits of Italian sausage and crushed candied walnuts.  Again, it strikes a great textural balance.  The brown butter sage gnocchi is also worthy.  The fries miss the mark.  The Truffle Parm taste of synthetic truffle oil, the Portobello fries, soggy, and the zucchini sticks overly crisp on the outside, overcooked and wet on the inside.

Small list of mains including a loco moco with demi instead of brown gravy (win!)  Tried all, no real standout, no real complaints.

Good, off Strip service.  Very fair prices.

Went with the gf and just ordered a few appetizers, the crispy gnocchi (super delish), the bacon wrapped meatball with dates (my personal favourite), seared crispy scallops (your missing out if you don't order), and the bruschetta with a cream cheese avocado topping. You really can't go wrong with any of those! 
The service was perfect, everything came out at a nice steady pace, the waiter was very friendly and the manager was welcoming, making sure everything was good and to satisfaction (A rare trait in todays restaurant world).

first of all, the decor and atmosphere creates an amazing intimate ambiance that is original and unmatched in local restaurants in Las Vegas. the style is eclectic and the music suites this place perfectly without overpowering customer's conversations. 

secondly, the food is fantastic! the seared diver scallops were beautifully cook and the spicy seafood pasta was phenomenal. 

Andy, the part owner/manager was very gracious and took great care of everyone equally. the customer service here is better than the 85% of the restaurants I've been to on the strip. I would sincerely recommend 'the sparklings' for that reason alone!

We ordered the gnocchi, sliders, ribeye steak, walnut beet salad and chicken fingers for the kids. Gnocchi was ok, sliders were the worst I've ever had, salad dressing was bland and served with beets from a can, chicken fingers looked like they came from Costco's frozen isle with a side of Hidden Valley ranch (cannot be mistaken), and the steak was an embarrassment for them to even send out! We asked for our steak to be prepared ""medium"" and it was far past well-done. Because the steak was so gray in color and lacked flavor we thought they may have boiled it...gross! In addition, service was horrible since they had 2 waiters for the entire restaurant while they were quite busy.  The decor looks really nice from the entrance but the minute you sit and look around you nothing makes sense. Never going back!

ch659,8/22/2014,revch1867,3,"I really liked the inside of the sparklings, its very comfortable and the staff were pleasant and clean. Parking wasnt too bad, and I also like the way they keep their bar area separate from the restaurant, its interesting. There is a separate lounge room for bar drinks and socializing but its kept apart from the restaurant dining room and can still be viewed via indoor window, i thought this was pretty smart since it keeps the dining areas ambiance more quiet and relaxing if you dont want the loud fuss of the people around the bar scene bothering you. Once you enter the center of the restaurant has a flower arrangement of orchids with seating protruding from this center and a large chandelier hanging from above. Decor has almost a modern mixed with antique feel to it. We ordered the crispy gnocchi, scallops, french onion soup, hamburger steak, and seared salmon. The scallops were good and I liked the sauce on them, the gnocchi was also good and had a pesto cream sauce and the gnocchi itself were lighty crisp out and soft inside. The french onion soup was good but a little on the salty side and the salmon was a little garlicky and also very salty but the flavor was good. Besides them needing to drastically reduce the sodium in their food I couldnt complain too much. The hamburger steak comes on a bed of rice loco moco style but has good flavor as well. Overall i thought this place was okay, but they need to really cut down on the salt before my blood pressure kills me. Be sure to get an extra glass of water to dilute your food if you decide to stop here.",negative
ch659,8/22/2014,revch1868,2,"I was so very looking forward to eating here.  got a takeout order, ordered the spaghetti with mushroom and bacon cream sauce, bacon date meatballs, and spicy seafood pasta.  the meatballs were quite good.  the date added a nice sweetness and anything wrapped in bacon is delicious.  the sauce was a little on the tangy side.  little bit too acidic if you ask me.  spaghetti with mushroom and bacon cream sauce was really good.  a very simple dish with few ingredients done very well.  highly recommend this dish.  the spicy seafood pasta was good and bad.  I would say the dish as a whole was great.  sauce was good, lots of seafood and large scallops.  only problem was the mussels were horrific.  they were spoiled rotten or something.  they smelled like poop.  I could not eat it.  the mussels pretty much ruined the entire dish for me.  not sure what was going on with the mussels, but they all smelled bad.  I'm iffy about going back after my experience.",negative

I came here for a birthday celebration. Our party was huge... 17 people! They were prepared for us and had the table set up with water for everyone before we got there. Super organized! The waiter was also really helpful and took his time with us. It can get pretty hectic with so many people. I was very impressed. They were also even able to split the check for us with no complications. No automatic gratuity included either! 

The food was decently priced and amazing. I was expecting to spend a bit more but was very satisfied with their prices. There aren't tooo many options for entrees but they have a lot of appetizers.

ch659,8/20/2014,revch1870,3,"When you live in Mountain Edge community and you want great nearby restaurant to eat, there are very few choices. One day, I went on Yelp and search for good nearby restaurant to eat, the Sparklings restaurant popped up and here we went.

When I walked in, I met the co-owner who used to manage the Oyshi restaurant located a couple blocks down the road. We went there during peak dinner time on the weekend but the restaurant wasn't crowded, but that could be because the restaurant has only been opened for a few months. There was a lot of people at the bar though.

Anyway, the place was nice and clean and the service was top notch. I looked at the menu and the prices are not cheap, kind of on the mid-tier level. Anyway, we ordered some appetizers and some entrees and here are our takes on it:

All the appetizers we ordered were excellent. The grape flatbread was ""da bomb"" and so was the grilled octopus and the scallops. We wanted to eat more of them after we devoured all in a very short time. As for the entrees, let just say that we were disappointed after starting out so well with the appetizers.

The steak was overcooked and dried, the spicy seafood pasty was kind of bland and under-seasoned and not spicy at all. 

Overall, it's decent and close to my house and that's why the 3 stars. I will come back but most likely I will just order the appetizers, especially the flatbread, and not the entrees.",negative
ch659,8/19/2014,revch1871,3,"This place is above average but I do not suggest here if you have a large party. Our poor waiter was serving the entire restaurant himself, and the bussing service was terrible. They left the water pitcher on our table and made my friend feel uncomfortable. I guess they left it there knowing it'd be a while before they came around again. Since it was a large group, they presumed we were all just sitting around mingling except we waiting an hour before getting asked if we wanted entrees. As for food, it was good but not anything I would come back for. We had the bacon date meatballs, Caesar salad, short ribs,  rib eye, Cajun pasta, crispy gnocchi,  seafood pasta, and sweet potato fries. Best was the short ribs.",negative

He was our server and he provided excellent service and an entertaining dining experience, and making us grateful we didn't walk out when we first walked in due to nobody else being in the restaurant (We found out later there was something big happening downtown, and that is why it was as empty as it was). The food was delicious and came out in a timely manner.  
     We ordered the calamari as an appetizer and believes when we say it was one of the best versions of the dish we've had, and we come a seafood town. I had the Atlantic Salmon, which had a crunchy twist making it a delectable treat. My friend had the shrimp salad, which was a good as a shrimp salad can be lol.

The waitstaff was amazing- very friendly and accommodating. I was warned when I ordered the spicy seafood pasta that the heat is about a 6 or 7 out of 10, but they can make a milder version. I'm really happy I was warned in advance- I think the mild version had the perfect amount of spice. 
The food was really good- I think there's room for improvement (I wasn't the biggest fan of the calamari in the pasta) however the friendly staff, price point and solid dishes make it worth trying out.

ch659,8/14/2014,revch1879,4,"To find a neighborhood gem that serves lovely food and great cocktails is always a plus in my book, and Sparklings is now a favorite stop for a few martinis and some great appetizers.  I have yet to try a main entree, which I assume is excellent, but their plethora of appetizers keeps me craving smaller plates over a nice, big steak.  The menu is simple--appetizers, soups, sandwiches, pasta and rice, and then entrees and desserts.  On our first visit, my husband and I went through four cocktails and about 6 appetizers.  Our bill remained well under $90 and we left happy.

My first suggestion is to try their apple & beet salad with candied walnuts along with their crispy gnocchi.  The gnocchi is rich and pillowy, while the salad provides that light contrast.  Move on to the scallops and brown butter gnocchi (if you don't mind doubling up on the gnocchi), then some grilled wings and meatballs.  Those bacon-wrapped meatballs with dates provides a salty and sweet dish with a side of grilled, sweet chicken wings.  We washed it all down with a few Chandelier martinis, a French 75, and a bourbon mule.  Hit it up with some creme brulee or cheesecake if you have room to spare, and your meal will be complete.

The service is impeccable and consistent. The manager, Andy, is now a good friend.  I've ordered about 90% of the menu, and it's all delicious.

The Truffles Fries were my favorite, plenty of garlic! Definitely tasted Asian fusion.

Meatballs were very good, could've been a little softer.  The marinara sauce was on the sweeter side, but I didn't mind it.

Scallops are a must!  Perfection indeed.  The seasoning and the way it was cooked was on point.

Ribeye was the worst part of our meal, and we had to send it back to the kitchen because it was cooked well done (we asked for medium).  There was no flavor and the look of the steak was ugly.

We replaced the steak with the braised pork.  The pork and sauce was amazing, and a huge rebound from the rib eye steak.

So overall, we will be coming back and recommending this place to everyone we know!  We will just let everyone know, not to order the rib eye steak!",positive
ch659,8/5/2014,revch1891,5,"I'm on the fence to select 4 or 5 stars. I wish there was a 4.5 stars option. The service was decent and the food definitely above average. Our service was very nice, but I felt it was a bit too casual considering how nice the food and interior looked.

There was a slight mess up on one order where they brought two of the same dish out. It was funny how the second dish ""looked"" better than the first dish. But the first dish tasted good so no complaints.

You definitely get your money's worth. A very nice establishment with very good food.",positive

ch659,8/4/2014,revch1893,5,"Quality of ambience and food for this price point??!!! A win-win for the Southwest part of LV! Phenomenal! I had a few appetizers- all incredible, and happy hour beverages. Prices are super reasonable, service was excellent, and the atmosphere/vibe in this restaurant are exquisite! I'll definitely be back!",positive

ch659,7/28/2014,revch1897,5,"After our first visit, we have come back to The Sparklings several times.

My co-workers had a dinner night-out and I highly recommended this place, and so everyone came in with the high expectations I set for them, and they were all please with the service and the food and thanked me for telling them about this place!

 We also invited our friends from out of town to join us and they also LOVED their experience here. 

This isn't a biased statement, but their Rib Eye steak is the best I've ever had in my life. I'd say better than the steaks I've ordered at a lot of higher-rated steak restaurants where you'd pay for it a la carte. They pick the best cut of meat that just falls apart when you cut into it. 

This has easily become my favorite restaurant, and EVERYONE needs to try it out, you won't be disappointed.",positive
ch659,7/28/2014,revch1898,5,"Went for a late night drink with my wife and we sat at the bar. We had the garlic fries and a couple IPAs. Great vibe, good food (our app was great), we will definitely be back for a traditional meal.",positive
ch659,7/25/2014,revch1899,5,Great service! Awesome food! I go there  4 Takeout. They are always accommodating and have my order ready when I arrived. I plan on dining in next week. I cannot wait! I highly recommend this restaurant!! They also do not allow smoking!!! Awesome!,positive
ch659,7/24/2014,revch1900,5,Really nice and fun decor. Waiter was great. Gnocchi appetizers was delicious. Had lunch sandwich and it's was very filling. Looking forward to going back!,positive
ch659,7/23/2014,revch1901,5,Loved the atmosphere and the staff was pleasant. So far everything I have tried tastes great. Love the bacon mushroom spaghetti!,positive
ch659,7/22/2014,revch1902,4,"SUPER darling interior and ambiance in the restaurant.  Menu is amazing too, some of the food didn't quite live up to my hopes but overall still very good.  Highly recommend for an affordable but nice night out. 

Also attended a baby shower here and it was wonderful!",positive
ch659,7/22/2014,revch1903,5,"I don't understand why this place is always dead, because the food is so delicious and prices are pretty good. My thought when I first ate there was, too bad this place is going to go out of business, because I really like it.

I've gone back a few times to help keep it in business, but I think it'll need more help. Go!",positive
ch659,7/22/2014,revch1904,5,"Love this place. We end up going a few times a month. Good food, good and friendly Servace",positive

Perfect place for a girls night out !",positive
ch659,7/18/2014,revch1906,5,"The bar teander\waiter was great. Funny and knowledgable. I orderd a cucumber french and was really pleased. It reminded me of this great cocktail at The Westin. We ate bacon date meatballs, capresse salad, sea diver scallops and crispy gnocchi. Every thing we ate was awesome!!!",positive
ch659,7/15/2014,revch1907,5,"I came here for a friend's birthday dinner and I totally did not expect the ambiance that I experienced when I walked in. From the outside, it doesn't really look the way it does on the inside. It's a very relaxed, yet sophisticated setting. Some tables are sectioned off with more privacy. The food is great. I definitely recommend this place.",positive
ch659,7/12/2014,revch1908,5,"Our first time coming here-myself and the boyfriend - we walked in and was impressed with the decor and atmosphere. We ordered a variety of dishes from the crab and spinach dip, bacon and dates wrap meatball and the turkey and cranberry sandwich. We both enjoyed the food immensely. The food was absolutely delicious- quality ingredients and gourmet taste at a very affordable price. The staff was extremely personable and I also liked the music a lot  this was our first time here but definitely will not be our last.",positive
ch659,7/6/2014,revch1909,4,"Had a great meal the crispy gnocchi defiantly saved this review!!

The host was great got us seated earlier then our reservation on a sat night, but on the other hand it was DEAD in there for a sat night. The wait staff was not on it that night either, it seemed like no one was sure what section they were serving.... took for ever to get one over and get our drinks.

I had a Moscow bourbon in a copper cup mmmmmm! And started with the crispy gnocchi which I will say again was my favorite! My meal was the rice au gratin with chicken very good but very rich! 

To finish they gave us a free flourless chocolate cake for my and my friends birthday! very good but, dense and rich , order a side of ice cream to go with defiantly needed . 

All and all I want to give this place another chance to get five stars I know they have it in them I just need that stellar service.",positive
ch659,7/6/2014,revch1910,5,I have been to The Sparklings 4 times and each experience was 5 star.  The food is delicious (great variety) and the ambiance and staff is superb.  I'm thrilled that we have a restaurant like this in the SW!,positive
ch659,7/6/2014,revch1911,5,"Love it!! First went here for my birthday back in January and have been a fan ever since! The atmosphere and decor is the first thing I noticed! Very intimate setting the provides a great feel. 

The prices are so reasonable along with the healthy portions of food! I love the Chicken Parmesan and my boyfriend first got the short ribs. The meat was so tender it fell of the bone! 

The happy hour is also a must do. Can't beat half off drinks right? I also love the management! He remembered us from the first time we came and genuinely cares about his customers and making sure they have a great experience! I highly recommend coming for any occasion; birthday, graduation, impromptu date night. It's a great spot you'll keep coming back to!",positive
ch659,7/4/2014,revch1912,4,"Overall pretty decent.  While the pricing is good, the portioning is commensurate with that pricing.  Overall it was pretty good, but since the portions were a little on the small side, you were left wanting.  The ribeye looked like a the same size as you would get with steak and eggs, and the file was maybe 5 or 6 oz.  The bar looks worthwhile and they happy hour specials looked to be of good value.",positive
ch659,7/2/2014,revch1913,5,"Perfect sized portions, Excellent Food and amazing atmosphere.  Its like nothing else in the SW part of the valley.. I stumbled upon it after finding out from a friend that his son worked there.

I used to pass by it thinking it was just another PT/Lodge type bar as the outside decor would make you think that.. However step inside and you are transported to a different world.

I have been back 3 times since then, its the perfect location to have a nice date night... not to expensive, not to high class... a great spot overall.  

I will be back again and again.

Oh Bonus !!! The Owner and Staff are all amazing..  Try out their cocktails !!!!!!",positive
ch659,6/30/2014,revch1914,4,"I tried this place a couple days ago thinking it was new, but when I asked to waiter they've been open since last year. The decor was beautiful, the atmosphere was chill, and the food was amazing. The waiter was nice and friendly, but pretty average service. The place was quite empty when we arrived, so we got seated right away.

Me and my friends ordered beers, the sweet potato fries, fried zucchini, bruschetta, and caesar salad as our appetizers. I was a bit irritated that the bruschetta on the menu did not state that it had seafood in it, as one of my friends is severely allergic to seafood. Good thing I tried it before he did, and immediately tasted the crab meat. I suggest they change the menu and put stars next to their seafood products as an indicator, because it only says ""cream cheese, avocado, and onion"" as the toppings. It was still quite delicious, but my friend was the one who ordered it and couldn't even enjoy it or try it.

As our main course selections I ordered the spicy seafood pasta. It was the perfect amount of spice and the seafood tasted fresh! And I'm usually very picky with how I like my seafood. Two of my friends both ordered the bacon and mushroom pasta, which I tasted. It was also delicious. My other friend had the clam linguini, which he thought was delicious as well, although I didn't try any. 

Overall, I gave 4 stars because the atmosphere and food was really good. I enjoyed it and would come back again. The only reason I docked 1 star was because of the lack of labeling of which appetizers have seafood. If he took a bite of it before I did, we would have ditch that place and make a trip to the ER fast!! Luckily that didn't happen!",positive
ch659,6/29/2014,revch1915,4,"The Sparklings is conveniently located around the corner from my home.  The decor reminds me of the tiny blue box from Tiffany's signifying class and elegance.  However this restaurant isn't pretentious whatsoever.  Dress up or go business casual. The food is really good...I have ordered the shrimp Po boy sandwich and the Cajun pasta before.  The flour less chocolate cake with raspberry is simply divine!  

Its been open for several month's however I get the feeling that not everyone knows this.  Once they get dialed in, then I'm sure we can count on them to serve us fine Las Vegas people what we want...brunch that is!",positive
ch659,6/29/2014,revch1916,5,Everything is delicious here!! From the drinks to the appetizers to the entrées!! Staff is super friendly and the management really cares about the service being provided,positive
ch659,6/28/2014,revch1917,4,"Love this place!  Super cute gem tucked away in a spot you would never guess.  A friend had to tell me about it or I never would have gone. Nice atmosphere with some fun decor.  There are lots of different seating postures so you can find what you like: sofa, lounge chairs, regular dining table, bar seating, and booth seating.  

The food is good as well. Didn't knock my socks off but definitely worth trying. 

The only reason I didn't give 5 stars is bc the service is slow. We were sitting in the lounge area in the bar so perhaps they just need to get a server to cover that area rather than the bar tender.

I will definitely be back!",positive
ch659,6/28/2014,revch1918,4,"Yes a fan I am! Here's why...first of all it's about time we have an upscale gourmet eatery in this otherwise chain restaurant laden area of SW Vegas. Secondly the food was very nice and at 30% off happy hour prices on a Friday night, we had a grand time trying a variety of appetizers which matched well with our prosecco (sparkling like the restaurants name) and novelty cocktails, I had a blueberry ginger mojito, or two...yet I digress...the food, bacon wrapped meatballs (divine), langostino bruschetta (splendid) and fried zucchini sticks (nice). The last but not least thing is the ambience... feminine, artsy, delicate yet comfortable... a contrast against the  predominately male staff.",positive
ch659,6/26/2014,revch1919,5,"I always get a great experience coming here. We always come in during the later hours and the bartenders are always really nice. The food is also just as good! Crab and spinach dip are my favorite! Last night I just tried the flourless chocolate with vanilla ice cream, it hit the spot! Atmosphere is just as nice too!",positive
ch659,6/18/2014,revch1920,5,"I've grown to be highly cynical of restaurants on Yelp that have 4+ stars, because I'm usually disappointed. A lot of Yelpers just don't have very good taste in food, so it's very hit or miss. 

After eating yesterday at The Sparklings, I left extremely impressed. I had three dishes there: a Caesar salad, the bacon and date-wrapped meatballs and the crispy gnocchi. All three were excellent! The service was prompt and friendly, and they take a lot of pride in their food. They have a lot of tapas-type offerings and a very pleasant dining atmosphere. 

This is a very exciting addition to the SW Las Vegas restaurant scene and I'm glad they're in my area. I really hope people support this great restaurant, because they truly deserve it. Do yourself a favor and check out The Sparklings!",positive
ch659,6/17/2014,revch1921,4,"My wife and I really like this place. The food is always well prepared, and they offer a solid variety of menu items. The tappas are very good - I really crave the gnocchi dishes as soon as I enter the building. Try the club sandwich - seems like a vanilla type item to order - but the Sparklings does it better than anyone.",positive
ch659,6/16/2014,revch1922,5,"My twin and I went there for lunch to try it for the first time. We were really impressed with everything. The place looks really nice n clean n our server, Crystal, was very helpful with the menu. She was very friendly and very efficient. We ordered the beet salad and the famous crispy gnocchi that Crystal recommended and we loved them both. For our entrees I ordered short rib and my twin ordered a rib eye steak. Everything was cooked to perfection. We will definitely be back. We are both in the restaurant industry so we will absolutely tell our friends at work to come check this place out. We were so surprised they weren't busy but maybe because they are new. We will definitely make The Sparklings  our new place to hang out! Thanks Crystal. U rock!!",positive
ch659,6/16/2014,revch1923,4,"Good food, great ambiance and service!! I had the short ribs and they were tender and falling off the bone moist n juicy!! Dessert was scrumptious and simply delish!! I plan on coming back and have recommended this place!",positive
ch659,6/15/2014,revch1924,5,"We attended a little get together and as I walked into this restaurant, it reminded me of a New York City lounge/restaurant place. its very trendy and the atmosphere was nice. Great place to have a bridal shower, baby shower, small type venues. 

The food was really good. They made it family style and it worked out great with everyone in the table. There were like 7 different dishes =chicken and shrimp jumbalaya, mussels, carbonara, chicken wings, scallops , garlic fries, arugula flat bread and they were all good. impressive. The owner and the waitress were really nice.

We had little kids with us and the waitress put them in their own table and entertained them with paper and crayons so the adults can enjoy.",positive

ch659,6/5/2014,revch1927,4,"Great atmosphere~ nice scene~ somehow it was when I dined with my family, prices for appetizer was reasonable but steaks were a bit pricy compares to cheesecake like similar restaurant classes... however for the foods we order like scallops, gnocchi, parmesan fries were unbelievable but meatball bacon dates was extremely salty which I leftover most of it other than that it rocks my pallet~ Im giving them 4 stars becuz my entree like clam linguine were no flavor also their soft drink price was extreme price where fountain iced tea was $3.50 and canned ginger ale too... if it was fresh brewed or organic.. I would definitely pay what it was but... disappointed... however as general service was decent food came out fast but just want them to make entrer have flavor into it and adjust prices on non alcoholic beverages or upgrade that to organic or fresh brew.. well done sparklings~",positive
ch659,5/31/2014,revch1928,3,"Saw a lot of great reviews and was recommended by my friend to dine here so I went a few days ago. I absolutely love the decor of the restaurant. Very classy & nice. They have few ""private"" type of seatings available for big groups so that was good.
Service was good too since there weren't too many groups in house- probably like 3 or 4? And a few at the bar.
Our waitress was very sweet and attentive; checked up on us a lot.
The owner/manager came out to chat with us as well & he seemed cool!
They have a good selection of food & drinks.

Now for the food: we started by ordering the  portobello fries. It was good & something different. For my main meal I ordered the spicy seafood pasta.
Now BEWARE it is SUPER SPICY!! The portion was huge with lots of seafood and it looked delicious but once you put it in your mouth, you were on fire! Even my friends who could tolerate spicy foods said it was pretty extreme. And because of this, it messed up my stomach for two days :( So if you're going to order this, I would suggest you to tell them not to make it too spicy. 
My friends ordered the hamburger steak, steak salad, cajun pasta, & ribs.
I didn't get to try any of their food but they all said it was delicious~
Especially the hamburger steak & ribs. 
Unfortunately for the steak salad, my friend's steak had a lot of fatty parts- where she couldn't eat so she told the waitress and they were able to bring out a new one for her.

Tons of parking outside of the restaurant.

I would like to go back next time but definitely will order something else.",negative
ch659,5/30/2014,revch1929,5,"5 stars for: food, drink, decor, ambiance, and Andy! First time meeting the owner but he was awesome. My friend that had an event at this restaurant introduced him and he was accommodating not only to her, but a lot of the guests. I overheard a lot of people calling out to say hello to him. I wish this place well, because it seems like everyone, staff and clientele are all happy in there.",positive
ch659,5/30/2014,revch1930,3,This place is beyond cute! But service is very limited here. We are celebrating a birthday party and only half of the table go to order their food :( I decided on the crab & spinach dip as an appetizer and it was okay. For my entree I got the Jambalaya and the rice was way too watery. My friend had the zucchini and those were delicious. Their happy hour was great and overall it was a good experience. Just wished the food was amazing.,negative

It's a quaint little Victorian style restaurant with amazing service and a great food/drink selection. We ordered the spaghetti bacon and mushroom with cream sauce, and the Cajun pasta which was both so delicious that we couldn't help but share! I also had a raspberry mojito which made me feel like I was on a beach in Tahiti. Yum! This is a must try!",positive
ch659,5/23/2014,revch1937,1,"What a shame... I wanted to love The Sparklings primarily because the decor is beautiful and it's a stylish restaurant in the Southwest. That being said, the food was atrocious. This was like one of those Hell's Kitchen episodes where Gordon Ramsay attempts to tell the owner how horrible his food is, and the owner is consistently in denial. We found the jambalaya particularly awful- soggy, bland, and without inspiration. The menu was unfocused and we will, unfortunately, not return.",negative
ch659,5/23/2014,revch1938,5,This place is amazing. Fancy food for really good prices. You can walk in with shorts and a tshirt on but it looks so nice! Food is also super awesome. Bartender I had was Ray. He was super. :),positive

ch659,5/19/2014,revch1940,4,"This place is really good! Like others have said, the decor is awesome. The chandelier is beautiful. Went tonight with my parents and husband. The restaurant wasn't full at all. Our waiter, Jason, was great. He was very personable and attentive. The food was good. We got the bacon & dates wrapped meatballs, gorgonzola flatbread with honey, and seared diver scallops appetizers. The flatbread was not crispy, it was chewy, and a little on the oily side. It wasn't bad, just not what we were expecting. Our entrees were the cajun chicken and shrimp pasta, jambalaya, spicy seafood pasta, and pan-seared atlantic salmon. They were all very tasty. No complaints. Definitely coming back.",positive
ch659,5/18/2014,revch1941,5,This place is amazing! It's my absolute favorite lunchtime restaurant. The Gorgonzola flatbread with honey is outstanding. Lots of choices for vegetarians. My boyfriend and friends love the bacon wrapped meatballs. The waiters here are very nice and pleasant. This place should be way more busy with the quality of food that you get.,positive
ch659,5/18/2014,revch1942,5,"I have been wanting to go here for months and I finally went with my bf. It was a Friday night 11:30pm. I was pretty surprised that this place stays open until 3am (its really awesome for a local restaurant) When we walked we were promptly greeted and seated.

Ambience:
The ambience is so cute, very grand and quaint at the same time. I love the mismatch motif. It's nothing I've ever seen before in Vegas. The Sparklings is like Alice in Wonderland meets Breakfast at Tiffany's. They played current EDM at the bar (where we sat at). 

Food:
We ordered the portobello fries and garlic truffle fries for an appetizer then ordered the spaghetti in cream sauce and a cheesesteak sandwich. For dessert we ordered the cheese cake. The pasta was perfectly al dente and the sauce was savory. The sandwich was served with a salad and it was succulent and juicy. 

Service: 
Everyone on staff was very hospitable. Our server was Ray the bartender. I don't know where to begin with how great Ray was. He made sure our drinks were always topped off and always checked up on us. I mentioned that it was my bf's birthday, nonchalantly, when we ordered our drinks at the beginning of dinner and when our dessert came out he put a candle on our cheesecake (little cues like that win me over; attention to detail). When my bf and I finished our lovely meal we sat at the bar and enjoyed a couple drinks. We had a wonderful time conversing with Ray. He is truly a wonderful bartender and a beautiful soul.

Overall:
Came for the experience and stayed for the service. 

The Sparklings is a must for Vegas...Go!",positive
ch659,5/5/2014,revch1943,5,"Food is amazing.  I have eaten here several times but find it disconcerting that their menu isn't available online.  It's 2014 sparklings, get with the times.  Sometimes I want to get food after a long day of work but have to get it elsewhere because they don't have an online menu where I can order and pick up to take home.  Btw, I miss the short rib they used to have.  Gnocchi is killer though",positive
ch659,5/5/2014,revch1944,5,"Found this on Yelp. There is a disconnect between the exterior and interior design, but that is to be expected off the strip. The interior is chabby chic and extremely cute! It was surprisingly empty on a Friday night. They have areas for more intimate private parties as well. We had a great waiter, attentive and friendly. The food was pretty good. My friends had a veggie sandwich and a shrimp poboy. They loved it. The spinach crab dip was pretty good & the gnocchi was awesome!! The only disappointment was the clam chowder, it was just ok..nothing great.",positive

The food is fair--slight better than The Sizzler with a wine list to match.  The scallops were over-cooked and the pasta dishes were unremarkable.  Even the chocolate cake was pretty average.  None of it's bad but unless you want to impress someone with the vibe I wouldn't say it's place worth going to more than once.",negative
ch659,4/16/2014,revch1956,5,"Great restaurant with a modern decor located about 15-20 min away from the strip. We came here during the day time and it was surprisingly quiet and almost empty (a few patrons were in the restaurant). We were greeted by an awesome waiter named Jason and his service was superb.

Tasted the prime rib which was by far the best prime rib I've ever had. It was very tender and almost melted like butter in my mouth. Their crab spinach cheese dip which was also delicious. As far as their Jumbalaya, it was a bit too salty.

Moderately priced. Overall great, I'd like to come to this restaurant again and try more of what they have on their menu.",positive
ch659,4/15/2014,revch1957,4,"Really cool addition to the southwest.  There are some excellent items on the menu.  I remember the bacon wrapped meatballs, never had that before in a restaurant.  I've had a lot of things wrapped in bacon, but never a meatball.  It was a nice touch.

Everyone will appreciate the interior of this restaurant.  It's spacious enough where you can have a big party and still feel private.",positive

It's not what you would expect (especially if you've been to the restaurant that was previously in this space), but you'll be pleasantly surprised! The decor is really cute, food is great and service is excellent. We've been here several times and enjoyed our meal every time.

Highlights are the salmon crostini, lobster bruschetta, meatballs, and spaghetti with mushroom and bacon.",positive
ch659,4/7/2014,revch1960,4,"I live fairly close to this place.  Finally decided to try it out so the wife and I went there on Saturday night.  The decor is awesome, wife and I agree we want our house to look like this!

The menu is decent, nice mix of appetizers and sandwiches and entrees.  We had a beet and apple pizza which was ok, not great and not bad.

I had the club sandwich on the recommendation of the server and it was pretty good.  Wife had a brie and ham sandwich (i think that is what was in it) and she said it was also good.  

There were a lot of families with young kids in there dining which was great, but the place was half empty on a Saturday at 7 pm.   I hope it was an anamoly and that it stays busy.  It is nice to have this place in the neighborhood and i hope it is around for many years to come.  Also, Lagunitas IPA on tap which is nice!",positive
ch659,4/6/2014,revch1961,3,"First of all, the decor in this place is gorgeous.  The detail, the style, all lend to a fancy, yet casual, bordering on hipster-esque, night out on Rainbow Blvd. 

I wanted to steal all of their furniture.  

Other positives include really friendly, but not creepy friendly, waitstaff.  Our food came out almost immediately and water was always timely refilled.

Okay, so, the food...

We ordered the following: diver scallops (appetizer), butternut squash gnocchi (appetizer), tuna tartare (appetizer); and fries.

The diver scallops were perfectly cooked but....there were only 3....and they were small (the rest were fried rice cakes).  The tuna tartare was also delicious but included only a small portion.  But, good execution all around.

The only things I didn't really enjoy were the butternut squash gnocchi and the fries.  You'd expect a sweetness in the butternut squash gnocchi but unfortunately the squash tasted unripe, making the dish a little bland.  The fries also, sadly, tasted a bit uncooked/raw (and cold).  I'm not sure how you mess up fries, but, those suckers needed way more time in the fryer.

Overall, I'd return because I had a great experience.  Some of the food, yes, was a little off, but I have a feeling it will improve.

3.5 Stars.",negative

ch659,4/3/2014,revch1963,4,"The Sparklings really filled a void for sit down dining in Mountains Edge. It's not ""upscale"" but beats many of the quick service places in strip malls. I would rate this as a great place to go on a date because of the atmosphere and prices. 

The menu is Italian mostly but offers sandwiches, steak and sea food. Most menu items are below $18 and are of a decent portion. 

I had a shrimp and chicken pasta my last visit and a plan spaghetti the first time. Both were really tasty, not the best I've had but a good value for the price. 

I haven't gone wrong with any of the appetizers especially the steak salad which has perfectly cooled steak along with sweet apples sliced into the mix. 

So many people who live in the southwest come here time and time again. Don't expect the flavors of Honeysalt, but you'll have a great meal!",positive
ch659,4/1/2014,revch1964,5,"This is definitely a hidden gem off of the strip.  Finally something hip and upscale and you don't have to deal with tourist.  I would have never expected a place like this from the owners of Oyshi and Soyo. Totally different aura and atmosphere from the others. There's a vintage hipster feel with a nice twist on the music.  Definitely a great place to bring a date or to celebrate a birthday with a group of friends. 

Now on to the important stuff. Food :)
We had an array of appetizers to start and ended up sharing a meal. We started with the langosta bruschetta which was to die for. Bread was perfectly crisp and didn't break into pieces when you bit into it. The added mango was a perfect addition to the topping.  We also had the sea scallops which had a little twist to them. Originally, I thought the entire plate was made up of only scallops but was soon to find out that they added crispy rice which when eaten with the scallop was amazing!   We also had the crispy gnocchi with pesto and walnuts which was also good and the fried zucchini. After trying all of the appetizers we could have skipped the zucchini. It wasn't bad but compared to the others it didn't compare. 

Lastly, we had the spicy seafood spaghetti. I am super picky with Italian food because I grew up with an Italian stepfather who could cook up a storm.  But I was so happy with this dish.  The spicy tomato sauce had a great kick and the taste was perfect to what I am used to. Spaghetti was al dente but I actually like it a little harder (if you know what I mean :). We ended this delicious meal with a perfect ending of creme brûlée. Equally as good as the rest.  

Once the word gets out this place is gonna be crazy! Enjoy it while you can. It's only been open for 5 months.  A must try!",positive
ch659,3/31/2014,revch1965,5,"As a party of two, we were seated immediately and received prompt and friendly service.  Had the butternut squash gnocchi, seared scallops, and caesar salad for appetizers.  Had the linguini with clams and the salmon for our entrees.  Had a flourless chocolate cake for dessert.  Every dish was phenomenal.  We got all of this, plus two glasses of wine and a beer, for under 100 bucks.  All around fantastic dining experience; we will be coming back.",positive

ch659,3/21/2014,revch1970,3,"on my updated review I am deducting a star.  They are open for lunch but have no lunch menu, specials, etc.  Same menu as dinner, which is too pricy for lunch considering every restaurant close by has specials.  They also charge way to much for a ice tea, $3.50 really?  They have a happy hour but it is for drinks only, no food specials which is very unusual.  I  got jumbulaya which could be considered soup the sauce was way to liquid, didn't even stick to the pasta or meat.  Friend got the cheesesteak and it was lacking in meat.  We love all the apps but the main courses still need a little work.",negative
ch659,3/17/2014,revch1971,5,"I'm going to go ahead & say that this is the classiest local hot spot on the southwest side of town. I visited during happy hour (5pm-10pm, 30% off all alcoholic beverages) for a friend's birthday, located right next to The Lodge. 

Every single dish I ordered was delicious: Crispy gnocchi, grilled octopus, sweet potato fries & the flourless chocolate cake. This was already expected since the owner of this restaurant also runs Oyshi & Soyo down the street & I love their food as well. The octopus dish especially surprised me because the meat itself was tender & held a lot of its flavor. Anthony was our server/bartender & he was very patient with our party & helpful with recommendations. Tasty cocktails too.. I'll definitely be coming back!",positive

ch659,3/14/2014,revch1974,5,"I feel sort of obligated to give them 5 stars, why... because they're just that awesome! Upon walking in, you will notice the amazing decor. Ambiance really made me give this place 5 stars, it is so beautiful I think they may have even hired a design team. White furniture, with pistachio green cushions. The chandelier is the focal point of the restaurant and gives it the restaurant's name sake ""The Sparklings.""  I came on a Wednesday during lunch and it was totally empty. I guess this is more of a dinner spot, but surprisingly the server said they are kind of busy on the weekends, but not so much. Sort of surprising considering how amazing this place is. So definitely people give them your business! Now on to the food, to start our meal we ordered the seafood bruschetta, so delicious! Loved it and the drizzle of pesto sauce made the dish look even more appetizing. For my main entree I had the jambalaya, something I've never had before. It was pretty good, but I was expecting a little bit more spice and flavor to it. To me it just tasted like chicken, seafood and tomato paste mixed with white rice.  I think it was definitely missing something but I can't exactly put my finger on since it was my first time having it. I think maybe it needed a garnish of scallions on top and the dish itself could of used more garlic? It was only $13 which is very reasonable for me because it was the perfect portion size. All the prices here are very affordable, the most expensive thing is the filet mignon at $25, which I consider almost robbery. My friend had the beat salad which he enjoyed very much. We shared the cheesecake as our dessert, this was totally store bought cheesecake and the server even admitted it not being made on site. I wish they had more dessert options, but the flour-less cake sounded good, I might have to order that next time. As Daniel T. mentioned it might be better to order 2 or 3 appetizers rather than an entree because the appetizers are all mouth watering.",positive
ch659,3/10/2014,revch1975,5,"Don't judge a book by it's cover...open the book!  South Las Vegas is growing and one by one new things appear.  Just recently Sparklings opened!  American/Asian influenced.  My husband and I walked in on a beautiful Thursday afternoon and to our surprise we were the only patrons there.  First impression is French Provincial!!! Velvet chairs, Glamorous Chandelier, many hutches of early american design with antique place wear.  They have 3 different pastel colored rooms for up to 10 seating in each off to the side of the main room, a room for private parties 12 or more you can close off to make it more personal and an open area with solid marble tables and Velvet seats and Benches for comfortable seating.  In another section there is a small bar and a door to outside seating if preferred.   The menu has very comfortable pricing for the dishes they serve, The wait staff is pleasant and warm, the owner even walked over to introduce himself and give kudos to their chef.  By the looks of this place and the quality that goes into their dishes I would think it's more an upscale restaurant, but as we left a man in torn jeans and baseball cap and a girl with shredded shorts and tank top came walking in and were seated and treated as if they were dressed accordingly...so I guess it doesn't have to be an elegant night out.  Every bite of every dish we ordered was excellent...even the teriyaki Octopus which was out of this world! The Salmon in lemon sauce and capers was fabulous as was the Cajun Shrimp Pasta!  Next time I'll make room for the chocolate flourless cake or Creme Brulee.  We will definitely go again and again!! Did I mention that we got excellent service from our waiter???

Despite me being too full to try the amazing looking food, the comments from friends were more than positive. It was happy hour which had drink and food specials from 10pm to close (2am - ish). Our server/bartender, Jose, was also such a personality and was absolutely a sweetheart. 

I wish this was in the NW close to me instead as it's a beautiful spot to hang out late night, and a lovely place to eat during day. It looks like a typical neighborhood lodge bar from the outside, but it totally isn't and doesn't serve plain ole' bar food.

I love it on the inside it soooo pretty and definitely different from anything you really get her in Vegas, on the outside you do not expect much at all and on the inside it looks soo clean, white, bright and spacious!! 
The food just did not really stick out to me much, I went with a group of friends and we literally ordered everything on the appetizer menu (which is huge!!!!!), I remember I hated the crab dip, sooo fishy it killed it for me. But i did like the sliders those were good, tuna tartar was good as well! Yet I do not really know if I liked or disliked the food there. If I had to form an opinion I would say go there for the ambiance and the drinks..... not so much the food.",negative

ch659,2/28/2014,revch1982,2,"I'm between 2 and 3 stars for this.

There is definitely a reason to come here, but it's not what you think. I wanted to come here as a sort of late night dinner. From the pictures, things looked good. Food was described as good. Sure, why not?

Maybe it was my expectation, but I will say the food we had was disappointing. Long story short, this is bar food. Maybe next time we're here, we'll try something else, but yeah, we felt kind of ripped off. What did we have?

- Fried zucchini. This was thoroughly over-battered and thus quite gross and kind of hard on the outside.

- Portobello fries. If you want a good version of this, go to Echo and Rig. If you want an exceptionally hard exterior, go to The Sparklings.

- Tuna tartare. Absolutely avoid this. It's a mix of tuna, mango and avocado served with three pieces of toast. The tuna was overly firm and flavorless. The mango and avocado under-ripe and hard as well. Nothing particularly binding it all together. Just some chunks in a cylinder shape. Not worth it.

- Crispy gnocchi. This was the only item we would have ordered again. An exceptionally flavorful heavy cream and cheese sauce covering a sort of crispy gnocchi, sausage, and nuts. It was nice, but kind of small.

Yeah, food is not their forte. So what is? Now I don't know if this is because it was late, but it was kind of shady even being in there. There was nobody up front. The whole place was empty. Just tables and tables in an otherwise abandoned room. You look to your right, there's a bar. It's a nice bar with nice bartenders. You will have a good beer and be able to sit on the nice couches and chat. Nice. But even then, it's not like it's expansive.

We got a booth. The seats were big, nice and comfy. The table has a marble top. The chandelier was so pretty and I love how they have flowers spell out ""The Sparklings"" in front. 

We shared a bunch of appetizers and a bottle of sparkling wine. Our bartender/server with wild hair seemed abrasive at first but he loosened up quick when my friend called him out and gave him a hard time the whole night. It was pretty hilarious.

Truffle Parmesan Fries:
Comes with ketchup and lemon garlic sauce. The lemon garlic sauce tasted like it had dill in it. The fries were crisp and were a cross between skinny fries and steak fries in terms of thickness and texture. 
 
Bacon and Dates Wrapped Meatball:
I like bacon-wrapped dates. I like good meatballs. But together smothered in marinara, it was a bit strange. I wish the bacon was a bit more crisp. 3/5

Tuna Tartare:
Fresh tuna with avocado and mango cubes.  It comes with crostini. This was alright. 3.5/5

Gorgonzola Flatbread with Honey:
Just like what the name implies - nothing complicated. It's simple yet tasty. Who doesn't like cheese and honey? 3/5

Grapes, Arugula and Ricotta Flatbread:
With candied walnuts and balsamic vinaigrette. This was good. Sweetness and juiciness from the grapes, peppery arugula, mild taste of ricotta and crunch from the walnuts. 4/5

Roasted Beet and Apple Salad:
With arugula, candied walnuts and balsamic vinaigrette. I don't like beets but this was pretty amazing. It looked pretty and the textures were wonderful. Soft beets, crisp apples and walnuts. 4/5

Crispy Gnocchi:
Gnocchi in pesto with Italian sausage, peas and candied walnuts. I love pesto and the sauce was spot on. The gnocchi was not as crispy as I expected. 4/5

Grilled Octopus:
Baby octopus marinated in soy sauce. It has a nice char to it. A different server put our plate of octopus on our table and said ""here's your octopuses"" which started a short-lived debate. He told us ""octopi is actually wrong...I looked it up"". Well, octopuses and octopi are both correct, actually      /endtangent. 4.5/5

Walking in, I was pleasantly surprised by the restaurant interior. It's very spacious and super cute. The perfect place for a date night or girls night out. We walked past the dining area and settled in at  the bar. Seats are comfortable and bartenders were friendly and very attentive. They have just about every bottle you can imagine, so you can request just anything your heart desires. I went with The Chandelier, from the cocktail menu, but my friend wanted and White Gummy Bear and the bartender was happy to oblige. 

The drinks were tasty and pretty reasonably priced. I debated ordering an appetizer while I was there, but decided to try to be good since we had just eaten dinner elsewhere. The food menu is extensive and everything seemed reasonably priced, so I look forward to coming back soon and trying some appetizers as well as entrees.",positive
ch659,2/17/2014,revch1987,3,"My girlfriend and I had dinner here last night in the lounge. The hostess had informed us that drinks were 30% off from 5:00 - 10:00 pm if they were served in the lounge. We were seated promptly and greeted by a friendly bartender.

On the way in, we walked through the dining room. Another reviewer described the interior as shabby chic, and we agreed. High ceilings, funky, fun furniture and a good amount of space between tables left an impression that this would be a great spot for larger groups of friends.

The cocktails we ordered were good and tasty, but a touch on the sweet side. The bartender warned us about one particular drink in that was VERY sweet, so we steered clear of that one. They did have a fine beer and and wine selection as well.

We ordered 3 appetizers and one main course. We began with the truffle fries, the bacon and date wrapped meatballs, the arugula and walnut flatbread, and finally, the jambalaya.

Everything was ok. Nothing really stood out, however. I'd call it bland, really, except for the negative connotation of the word. So, a shade tastier than bland. The jambalaya especially had virtually no spice in it at all. The fries and the flatbread were probably the most flavorful -- the fries due to their garlic, herbs and truffle oil and the flatbread had amazing fresh basil.

The jambalaya did arrive already split on two plates for us which was a nice touch. We were too full for desert afterwards. The three apps, one main course, and four total drinks (two for each of us) came to about $60.

We look forward to returning as they are open late (2:00 am most nights I think) and sampling again from the menu.",negative

we had a large group and i called a couple of weeks ahead to reserve their party room (seats 12). the room was just as lovely as the rest of the place with chandeliers and comfortable seating. 
our whole group of 12 was quite impressed with the food. steaks were large and looked wonderful. my husband had the grilled veggie sandwich and said it was really good. we both had some sweet potato fries and they were delicious.

ch659,2/16/2014,revch1990,3,"Found this restaurant on yelp and decided to give it a try this past Saturday night.

Love the proximity of the location to my house.  Less than 5 minutes away.  It's located in the Southwest part of town, near the Blue Diamond area.

The restaurant itself is very spacious and there's a beautiful chandelier in the center of the restaurant.  There's more of the long table seating and humongous booths than there is for couples.

Unfortunately, it was DEAD on a Saturday night.  Very surprising considering it is ""Valentine's Day"" weekend.. although there were several others dining it, it was just a bit too quiet that night.

As for the food, we ordered:
- Calamari salad for an appetizer (A-ok.. I wouldn't order again)
- Crispy gnocchi with italian sausage and peas (the sauce was very tasty!  however the more I kept eating, the more I felt it was a bit too creamy and heavy for my liking)
- Cajun Chicken and Shrimp Pasta (yummy & tasty.. sauce was just right)
Prices were overall reasonable.  For our meal, we spent just about $30 or so.

Server we had was nice and just the right amount of attentiveness.

ch659,2/14/2014,revch1992,5,"First time there and will not be the last. Very similar to Honey Salt in summerlin. Nothing else like this in the Southwest part of the valley. Great for a date night or casual dinner. VERY reasonable prices. Shabby Chic interior is a great setting 

We started with the caprese salad, bacon and date wrapped meatball and the scallops. All fantastic.   Main course filet mignon and chicken parm. Not much to say about the parm. Pretty basic but very good. Filet was melt in your mouth good. Outstanding meal.  Desert was creme brule and flour less chocolate cake. Both were delicious.  

Service was very attentive even though they were very busy for Valentines day. Definitely coming back. Nice to have this kind of place so close to home",positive
ch659,2/11/2014,revch1993,4,"My husband and I got to try this place on Saturday for our date night. Walking in, oh mygoodness, it is so cute. They have this cute little sign written in flowers, and a beautiful chandelier right in the center of the room surrounded by lavish vases and fresh cut (they looked fresh) flowers. I love the decor of this place! They also had walled off areas that seem perfect for families so they could contain the madness within those little walls (or at least try to). 

Okay, on to the important things! We tried 4 different appetizers & a sandwich to share. We were stuffed by the end of our meal. We had zucchini sticks, dates and meatballs wrapped in bacon, crispy gnocchi, crab spinach dip, and a philly cheese steak. I wasn't blown away by any culinary feats happening over here although I did enjoy the meatballs. They were definitely the best dish out of them all. The crispy gnocchi looked very skimpy compared to the photos others have posted and they weren't very crispy... I wish there were more veggies or something to it. It was very green and kind of boring to eat with those soft peas and the soft gnocchi. The best part were the pecans in it. However, I think the selling points are that they are open very late, and provide a nice alternative to in-n-out. The prices are ridiculously low. We spent $35 on all that food, and it's in a beautiful surrounding. Therefore, we will be back and I want to try the portobello fries!",positive
ch659,2/11/2014,revch1994,5,Great new restaurant in Vegas. Staff was very polite and attentive. The menu has basic items but doubt mistake it for the quality. The food was amazing! Happy hour is from 5-10pm I was informed. Our bartender was Jose who was excellent and took our long order by memory which was highly impressive. This is definitely one of my new casual go to spots.,positive
ch659,2/6/2014,revch1995,5,"No need to hit the Strip.  The place os wonderful.  So very pretty inside!  Food was fantastic!  Our server Char was great.  One of the owners Andy came by a few times to check on us.  I am very excited to have this beautiful place right around the corner!  Highly recommend! Parm garlic fries, are to die for!",positive
ch659,2/3/2014,revch1996,2,The service was the best!!! The food was horrible!! Will be back to try again only because of the service ...,negative
ch659,2/1/2014,revch1997,5,"This place is a new favorite for date night. GREAT and personable owner. Love the posh decor and vibe of the place. The fiancé and I want to have our rehearsal dinner here. Still loving the food and the short ribs are still my favorite. Tried the honey flatbread appetizer, meatballs, and creme brûlée last time I visited. I have yet to be disappointed by anything I try.",positive
ch659,1/31/2014,revch1998,5,"Great local spot. Happy hour in the bar from 5-10pm everyday, so that is a plus. The food is very good, the menu is not too large, but diverse, and the prices are great for the quality. I love their clam chowder, and the turkey, cranberry and brie sandwich is absolutely delicious.  It is great to see places like this opening up in the Mountain's Edge area.",positive
ch659,1/29/2014,revch1999,4,"This place is pretty great. I've loved all their food so far, except for the clam linguini (the sauce was a bit bland) but other than that, can't speak highly enough of this place. The waitstaff is friendly and attentive and you can tell they want you to keep coming back. Their flour-less chocolate cake is super rich and decadent and tastes GREAT with their espresso. Best dessert ever. The atmosphere is really interesting but difficult to describe. The ornate chandelier in the middle of the room turned us off at first, because we assumed it meant the food would be really expensive. Not so! The appetizers, sandwiches and pasta entrees are very reasonably priced. They do have more expensive steaks and things but I'm sure they're top grade and worth the money. (I haven't had their steak yet.) 

It does feel like they haven't quite found their ""niche"" yet (the type of music they play has changed a few times, the atmosphere is really neat but you can't quite tell what theme they're going for etc.), and while the waitstaff is friendly and attentive, they do feel short-staffed a lot of the time. I think as business continues to pick up, they'll hire more people and it will improve the service. All in all, I will keep coming here and I hope more people discover this place and decide they love it.",positive
ch659,1/28/2014,revch2000,2,"This place is different.  When you walk in you expect it to be ultra fancy but it really isn't.  The food was okay, really bland.  I expected it to all taste better.  And unfortunately it took forever for us to receive our food. 

I won't be returning.",negative
